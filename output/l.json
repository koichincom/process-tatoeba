One of our last meetings in the neighbourhood was at the Rideau School field. We discussed plenty. Russia and China had been \"State Capitalist\" regimes and not \"Communist\" as they claimed to be. There was an alien \"spacecraft\" hovering invisibly above the grassy field; oh no, it was some kind of \"portal\"; oh no, it was an \"incorporeal being.\" Many East Asian logograms, or \"Sinograms,\" had a categorizing radical along with a hinting phonetic radical; they were not all pictographic. Daoists, I said, liked to be like a simple driftwood. There were aliens aplenty, Bratislav repeated. That day on the field last month, the thousands of dandelions were abundant with cloudy tufts of their soon-to-fly seeds.",

Then, I went to the grocery store looking for dried anchovies, but there was none, according to the two Filipina workers there, so I bought instead five packets of frozen crab-flavoured wild pollock, or kamaboko, and a bag of frozen sole fillets. Then, I went to the cafe, where there was a long line. In front of me was a big boy in shorts, his meaty legs showing. A stocky man in a grey T-shirt and black track pants came in and out. An old man was reading an old book about the ice-hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Drinking my black iced tea, I sat near a table of a Bosnian couple, speaking Bosnian. The cafe music was multilingual, and I could hear Mexican lyrics,\"Llorando, llorando, llorando\": \"Crying, crying, crying.\" An old man who was a regular before and had moved to White Rock gave me a little KitKat chocolate bar, wrapped in red paper. In the afternoon, I returned to the packed pizzeria to enjoy a pesto cheese slice and iced black diet cola. I could not sit in my usual corner. There were multiracial girl students, with expensive bubble teas. Outside near the greengrocery, white students walked by, saying, \"We rather have salvation from suffering.\" It was drizzling.",

I had a Hawaiian slice and iced tea. Then, I went to the grocery store looking for dried anchovies, but there was none, according to the two Filipina workers there, so I bought instead five packets of frozen crab-flavoured wild pollock, or kamaboko, and a bag of frozen sole fillets. Then, I went to the cafe, where there was a long line. In front of me was a big boy in shorts, his meaty legs showing. A stocky man in a grey T-shirt and black track pants came in and out. An old man was reading an old book about the ice-hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Drinking my black iced tea, I sat near a table of a Bosnian couple, speaking Bosnian. The cafe music was multilingual, and I could hear Mexican lyrics,\"Llorando, llorando, llorando\": \"Crying, crying, crying.\" An old man who was a regular before and had moved to White Rock gave me a little KitKat chocolate bar, wrapped in red paper. In the afternoon, I returned to the packed pizzeria to enjoy a pesto cheese slice and iced black diet cola. I could not sit in my usual corner. There were multiracial girl students, with expensive bubble teas. Outside near the greengrocery, white students walked by, saying, \"We rather have salvation from suffering.\" It was drizzling.",

Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility.

He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

Meanwhile, indigenous languages have continued to be the aural-oral mainstay, with Spanish loanwords being quite common. In 1937, administration chose Tagalog as the basis of the national language. As time passed, code-switching between English and indigenous languages became more prevalent. As a result, the Philippines is a linguistic hodgepodge. English is like an effervescent pink drink, and Tagalog is a grey shark in the seas. Spanish still rings nostalgically of bygone majestic good ol' days for many Filipinos.

It is really too bad that literature in indigenous languages there is still scarce. A trip to a bookstore in the Philippines reveals many books in English, but a mere small section in Tagalog. People speak an indigenous language ordinarily, every day, but when they read or write, it is often English. But texting on cellphones and smartphones and in Social Media may often be abbreviated Taglish code-switching. Many Filipinos prefer television, cinema, or videos in an indigenous language, rather than read English, which to them is still foreign cold. Maybe, Roman letters are too rigid for their Asian eyes, unlike the ancient Baybayin script, which nowadays people relegate to tattoos and patriotic T-shirts.

These days, I talk with Greg, my religious Filipino friend, at Starbucks café. We talk about travelling, anthropology, international food, and religion. This morning, I played in the midst of dense fog in a neighbourhood grassy field. At Starbucks café, in the foggy morning, I was drinking my reddish Passion Tango iced tea, which contained hibiscus, lemongrass, cinnamon, passion fruit, pineapple, and so forth. Greg gifted me a chocolate croissant. At Starbucks café, in the grey-sky afternoon, I was drinking the seasonal Oat Nog Latte. (Incidentally, Nog is a dwarf-like Ferengi alien character in the Star Trek franchise.) Kristina, part-Inuit part-Norwegian, was my barista. She has a handsome face, and her mannerisms and style reflect some things about her Inuit ancestors. \"Viktor, it's like you're part-Inuit,\" she told me. She knows that I am from the Philippines.

After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013.",

        "The analysis of gender in religion or spirituality is an esoteric theme. I for one am attracted to Buddhism, because of its masculine viewpoint about reality. Buddhists accept prevailing discontent as a condition of this illusory world, the Māyā hiding true reality, but paradoxically, they promote equanimous joy. They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so. Some sci-fi buff friends of mine think that all I need is sci-fi as an exercise in understanding reality through irreality, something I have been doing since reading Dr. Seuss imaginary books in Grade 1. I analyse that it may have been originally Dr. Seuss books that encouraged me to pursue the sci-fi imaginarium throughout my life. Some sci-fact buffs, however, incline away from sci-fi, which they may think is childish, frivolous \"hypotheticals.\" I believe also in sci-fact, invigorated by sci-fi excursions.",

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

In Tokio one may find streets, or narrow alleys, lined with a continuous row of the cheapest shelters; and here dwell the poorest people. Though squalid and dirty as such places appear to the Japanese, they are immaculate in comparison with the unutterable filth and misery of similar quarters in nearly all the great cities of Christendom.

In such a world flight was very desirable, but owing to the strength of gravitation only a small creature, a relatively small mass of molecules, could fly. A brain large enough for complex \"human\" activity could not have been lifted. In such worlds the organic basis of intelligence was often a swarm of avian creatures no bigger than sparrows. A host of individual bodies were possessed together by a single individual mind of human rank. The body of this mind was multiple, but the mind itself was almost as firmly knit as the mind of a man. As flocks of dunlin or redshank stream and wheel and soar and quiver over our estuaries, so above the great tide-flooded cultivated regions of these worlds the animated clouds of avians maneuvered, each cloud a single center of consciousness.",

They include a bird-like dinosaur, dubbed the “chicken from Hell,” that was 3.5 meters from beak to tail and weighed as much as 300 kilograms; a spider that lives in the Moroccan desert and can use its gymnastic talents to cartwheel out of danger; a 23-centimeter-long walking stick common in Vietnam; and a colorful sea slug from the Japanese islands that is the missing link between slugs that feed on colonies of tiny stinging jellies and those specializing on corals.",

        "A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure that’s either much higher or lower than the surrounding atmosphere. Think of it like a strong tank built to safely manage these pressure differences without bursting or leaking. They are commonly used in industries like oil and gas, chemical processing, and power generation. For example, they might store compressed air, gases like hydrogen, or even liquids used in industrial processes. Pressure vessels can be shaped like cylinders, spheres, or cones, and they’re made from strong materials like steel to handle the stress caused by high pressure. What makes pressure vessels special is the way they’re built to ensure safety and durability. Since working with high pressure can be dangerous, there are strict rules and tests to make sure these vessels are reliable. Engineers carefully design them, often following standards like the ASME code, and test them to make sure they can handle real-world conditions. They’re not just for storage; they also play a role in things like chemical reactions or heat transfer. In short, pressure vessels are critical tools that help industries operate efficiently and safely.",

As I entered Starbucks café, sitting at a table with two Doritos bags of chips, one purple and one red, were Peter the redheaded Anglo and Hans the Netherlander on a motorized wheelchair, who offered to me. I took a few chips from both bags. Then, I was drinking reddish Passion Tango iced tea, then Oat Nog Latte. I was munching on crème brûlée almonds. I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish). I said that it was \"rāmen.\" Homebound, walking, I accidentally tripped on a wooden board in a dark alleyway. My eyeglasses fell off. Luckily, I was not hurt. A Cantonese labourer helped me.

In the Philippines, my native Tagalog from childhood has Spanish words embedded in it. I eventually took Spanish at university in BC. I had introductory French in Grade 5 on Lulu Island, continued it in high school, then in post-secondary education. I have learned the rest autodidactically. I have reading strength in my languages, but not much in speaking, except in Esperanto, in which I have attained a high level, partly due to my participation in various clubs. I enjoy reading novels in the different languages, especially in the genres of science fiction and fantasy, as I immerse myself in far-flung worlds. Romanian is for me still a vampiric curiosity, which I have not explored much. Additionally, I am curious also about Ladino, also known as Judeo-Spanish.

        "Gnosticism was a religious movement older than Christianity. There were both types of Christian and non-Christian Gnosticism because there was syncretism, or mixing. They believed that humans were trapped in their bodies and in this evil material world that was created by a cosmic disaster, by a malevolent deity who was not Christ. Christian Gnostics believed that Christ was one of the aeons or divine beings from the Pleroma, the Divine Realm, as described in the Apocryphon of John, part of the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic literature. Salvation was by esoteric knowledge, although ultimately self-knowledge. Gnostics believed in the dualism of the good spirit and evil matter. The material world was an evil place from where Gnostics had to escape. They believed that not all humans had the Divine Spark. The aeons emanated from the Ultimate God, the Monad in the Pleroma. The origins of Gnosticism are unclear today, but probably it came from Persia or further east. It had a lot of Greek influences. Today, after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library as leather-bound papyrus codices in a sealed jar in Egypt, in 1945, some people are trying to revive Gnosticism. \"Gnōsis\" is Greek for knowledge.",

The banners in the high-ceiling main chamber are purple, signifying support for Lojban and things Lojbanic, perhaps. By lunchtime, I am at the Richmond Public Market. I take the stairs up. First, I drink a plastic glass full of Sour Plum Bubble Iced Green Tea from a bubble tea vendor called Peanuts. Second, from the food vendor Captain Wa at a corner, I eat Noodles with Lemon Chicken, Tofu, Lotus Root Slices, as well as complimentary Hot Tea. Third, I drink a Starfruit Bubble Iced Green Tea from Peanuts, again. Fourth, having taken the escalator down, I buy a strange sinographic dictionary of a strange Asian Mainland tonal language. Fifth, having gone up the escalator, I drink a Mint Iced Tea from a bubble tea vendor called QQ Bubble Tea & Coffee. (The Q maybe is support for my Xoqolat.) The cold mint drink reminds me of my drinking mint at a café in Versailles in France, years ago. The Richmond Public Market is like a big garden atrium, as if in the middle of a tropical jungle. It is full of Kanjifolk.",

After lunchtime, sunny then, I went to the cafe for iced black tea. There were old Russian men, perhaps with a bit of Hun or other Mongoloid ancestry. A handsome medium-height dark-haired bearded man in army-green pants was waiting in line. Like engraved or sculpted through his light sweater in light grey were his nipples and tight muscles. At my table, a brown student seated himself to eat a black box of sushi with chopsticks and drink a red can of black cola. There were many multiracial students standing around.",

Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous halo of red-gold hairs, which on the head became a russet mop. Their golden eyes, reminiscent of the snake, were more enigmatic than profound. Their faces were compact as a cat's muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and races. These surprising organs, which would have seemed merely ludicrous to the First Men, were expressive both of temperament and passing mood. They were immense, delicately involuted, of a silken texture, and very mobile. They gave an almost bat-like character to the otherwise somewhat feline heads. But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six antennae of living steel.",

        "In Japanese, conjugation is fundamental to piecing words together with auxiliaries. For example, to express the polite past, we must first take the \"ren'yōkei\", or \"continuative\", conjugation of a given verb and attach it to the auxiliary ます (masu). When we do this with a verb such as のむ (nomu), it becomes のみます (nomimasu), at first. This is the polite form, as ます forms the polite. To properly express the polite past in full, we must add the auxiliary た. The stem of ます (masu) is a simple \"mas-\" sound. Since it ends with an S sound, a change occurs when we attempt to add た. The resulting \"masta\" is difficult to pronounce and not easy to write in Japanese, as it neglects the common consonant-vowel spelling rule. So, a compromise is made, also known as an 音便 (onbin), or, literally, a \"sound convenience\". The \"masta\" takes on an I sound between the stem's end and the auxiliary's beginning. Since there is no \"si\" in Japanese, \"shi\" is used instead. The resulting conjugation is のみました (nomimashita). When pronounced, it may be contracted and read as \"nomimash'ta\".",

So these very small materials behave in ways that are not yet completely understood, and just the fact that they are unimaginably small creates a lot of the controversy. People fear that smaller nanotech particles in the environment might be accidentally absorbed by the human body, that invisible surveillance devices could watch our every move, or that microscopic new weapons would threaten our security in unforeseen ways.",

Manila was the 9th largest Spanish-speaking city in this world in 1930 with 324 552 inhabitants. The switch to English for at least written communication was set in motion. Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media. Spanish embedded itself as many natural-sounding loanwords within Tagalog, Taglish, and other native languages. Tagalog had not been fully \"intellectualized\" as a language, as many great international works had not been translated into it. Tagalog used in non-humanities fields of science remained only experimental. Artificial Intelligence and machine translation might give Tagalog a \"kangaroo-hopping\" boost.",

English sounds and text don't really appeal to the masses, but English is a hesitantly established piece of furniture, useful for understanding the outside world.

I would give myself three stars out of five stars total for my Chabacano skills. I can read it quite well. I like that Chabacano has no verbal conjugation, but just has aspect markers, unlike Spanish. I assign the colour beige to Chabacano. I opine that more people should know it. I trudged in the snow going to Tim Hortons, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. In the morning were Earl Grey tea with oat milk and a roast beef Craveable sandwich. (Earl Grey was Captain Picard's favourite.) In the afternoon was an iced coffee with oat milk and cane sugar. Gurpreet the Indian was the vendor. Corpulent Dominic and his daughter Fiel, Filipinos, were sitting near the bay window overlooking the snowy street. I saw in passing Gary the Cantonese in green camouflage Vietnamese military pants, as I exited the washroom and eventually the café itself. For lunch at home, I had spaghetti with Mexican banana chips and a glass mug of hot lime water. Yesterday, Gary and I discussed horseback riding. I tried it, but I could not control the horse well. Gary lived in earlier years near North Vancouver's stables. He preferred motorcycling, as in Vietnam. I said that I was too \"klutzy\" for such.",

        "A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure that’s either much higher or lower than the surrounding atmosphere. Think of it like a strong tank built to safely manage these pressure differences without bursting or leaking. They are commonly used in industries like oil and gas, chemical processing, and power generation. For example, they might store compressed air, gases like hydrogen, or even liquids used in industrial processes. Pressure vessels can be shaped like cylinders, spheres, or cones, and they’re made from strong materials like steel to handle the stress caused by high pressure. What makes pressure vessels special is the way they’re built to ensure safety and durability. Since working with high pressure can be dangerous, there are strict rules and tests to make sure these vessels are reliable. Engineers carefully design them, often following standards like the ASME code, and test them to make sure they can handle real-world conditions. They’re not just for storage; they also play a role in things like chemical reactions or heat transfer. In short, pressure vessels are critical tools that help industries operate efficiently and safely."

In most cases this state of affairs had arisen through the necessity of combining intelligence with lightness of the individual body. A large planet, rather close to its sun, or swayed by a very large satellite, would be swept by great ocean tides. Vast areas of its surface would be periodically submerged and exposed. In such a world flight was very desirable, but owing to the strength of gravitation only a small creature, a relatively small mass of molecules, could fly. A brain large enough for complex \"human\" activity could not have been lifted. In such worlds the organic basis of intelligence was often a swarm of avian creatures no bigger than sparrows. A host of individual bodies were possessed together by a single individual mind of human rank. The body of this mind was multiple, but the mind itself was almost as firmly knit as the mind of a man. As flocks of dunlin or redshank stream and wheel and soar and quiver over our estuaries, so above the great tide-flooded cultivated regions of these worlds the animated clouds of avians maneuvered, each cloud a single center of consciousness.",

They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so.

From age 10 and above in Canada, I learned Canadian English writing, up to university level. My appetite for science fiction and fantasy books from both American and British authors has affected my writing style. Some Cantonese opine that my writing is British, and it reminds them of England. My philosophy is that English is an international language and its origin can be divorced from its essence, as the case, I think, also of Spanish and French. Ergo, I urge Cantonese to divorce the essence of English from its land of origin.

This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

And one of them named Sheffield, a mercer, came into a house and asked for food, and specifically he asked for 'egges', and the good woman answered that she could speak no French. And the merchant was angry, for he could also speak no French, but wanted to have 'egges', and she didn't understand him.

After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013.",

After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam.

This would proliferate into little sextuped burrowers, swift and elegant sextuped grazers, a sextuped mammoth, complete with tusks, and many kinds of sextuped carnivora. Man in these worlds sprang usually from some small opossum-like creature which had come to use the first of its three pairs of limbs for nest-building or for climbing. In time, the forepart of its body thus became erect, and it gradually assumed a form not unlike that of a quadruped with a human torso in place of a neck. In fact it became a centaur, with four legs and two capable arms. It was very strange to find oneself in a world in which all the amenities and conveniences of civilization were fashioned to suit men of this form.",

Like an effervescent pink drink, English is now the main written language in the Philippines. However, the de facto aural-oral lingua franca in the archipelago is Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two official languages, Filipino (Tagalog essentially) and English. Chabacano (Chavacano) combines Spanish with native elements. There is in Chabacano no verbal conjugation that does exist in Spanish, Tagalog, and English, which complicates these languages. Native languages in the Philippines have oodles of Spanish-derived words embedded in them. Native languages are of the Austronesian family, said to have originated thousands of years ago in Taiwan. About 200 languages exist in the Philippines. Most of them are of the Austronesian family, whilst Chabacano, an outgrowth of Hispanic colonization, sprouted like mushrooms in various places there.",

Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media.

Filipinos generally are not known as avid readers, except for elite people maybe entrenched in the margins of the Anglosphere. Literature in the indigenous language is still relatively scarce.",
        "In the beginning of the twentieth century, the Philippine elite started switching from Spanish to English as the archipelagic elitist language, especially in written form, as a consequence of the Spanish-American War in 1898. Meanwhile, indigenous languages have continued to be the aural-oral mainstay, with Spanish loanwords being quite common. In 1937, administration chose Tagalog as the basis of the national language. As time passed, code-switching between English and indigenous languages became more prevalent. As a result, the Philippines is a linguistic hodgepodge. English is like an effervescent pink drink, and Tagalog is a grey shark in the seas. Spanish still rings nostalgically of bygone majestic good ol' days for many Filipinos. Tagalog is still not as fully \"intellectualized\" as its cousin Indonesian, which Indonesians use in university-level education and has extensive literature.",
        "The Arabic word \"siraat\", the English word \"street\" and the German word \"Straße\" are all Latin loanwords borrowed from the Roman word \"strata\".",
        "As we no longer alter the spellings of loanwords to match typical English spelling conventions, this leads to many words with unusual spellings, like \"guanxi\", \"qarin\", \"kawaii\" and \"burqa\".",
        "Sometimes, in Tagalog, loanwords are mixed Spanish and English. There are words like \"haydroponiko,\" being half-English, half-Spanish. These kinds of newfangled words can often be heard or seen on TV, in the news, etc.",
        "Maltese also has a large number of loanwords from English and Italian.",
        "There is not a language which doesn't have some loanwords.",
        "On its way to Americanization since the Spanish-American War of 1898, in the 1930s, the Philippines was still somewhat a Hispanic country. Manila was the 9th largest Spanish-speaking city in this world in 1930 with 324 552 inhabitants. The switch to English for at least written communication was set in motion. Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media. Spanish embedded itself as many natural-sounding loanwords within Tagalog, Taglish, and other native languages. Tagalog had not been fully \"intellectualized\" as a language, as many great international works had not been translated into it. Tagalog used in non-humanities fields of science remained only experimental. Artificial Intelligence and machine translation might give Tagalog a \"kangaroo-hopping\" boost.",
        "Maybe, Filipino dictionaries need upgrading to include English loanwords with Filipinized spelling. I am thinking of English-derived words like \"metabolisem.\" Sometimes, some Filipinos would prefer it to the more well-established Spanish-derived word \"metabolismo.\" Though \"metabolisem\" does not exist in Filipino dictionaries, maybe it and others like it should. The current treatment of English loanwords is to spell as is from the English, unlike what is done for Spanish loanwords.",
        "Words such as \"azul,\" \"tanemmirt,\" and \"aselmad\" are modern Berber. They come from various Berber dialects and are not known in the Kabyle dialect. In fact, Kabyle uses words such as \"ahla\" for \"hello,\" \"ṣaḥḥa\" for \"thank you,\" and \"ccix\" for \"teacher,\" and all these words are Arabic loanwords that are used and understood from Mauritania to the farthest reaches of Saudi Arabia. Denying the existence of the Berber language and modern Berber is completely useless and it is usually politically motivated.",
        "Filipinos don't believe in language purity, as they mix languages, typically Tagalog and English, freely, this code-switching being called Taglish. Tagalog proper is already full of Spanish loanwords and borrowings from other languages, like Hokkien. The Philippines is under the American sphere of influence, and code-switching is how Filipinos deal with modernization. Tagalog has an \"old attic\" of vintage words, with which modern Filipinos are less familiar, but which are still in common use in rural areas and with old folk.",

When I heard from afar people speaking either of these two languages, I often mistook it for the other. These languages were funny in the way the vowels \"squished\" or \"bloated\" like rubber, depending if they were unstressed or stressed. Afterwards, I ate chocolate-laced Italian biscotti.

Then, I went to the grocery store looking for dried anchovies, but there was none, according to the two Filipina workers there, so I bought instead five packets of frozen crab-flavoured wild pollock, or kamaboko, and a bag of frozen sole fillets. Then, I went to the cafe, where there was a long line. In front of me was a big boy in shorts, his meaty legs showing. A stocky man in a grey T-shirt and black track pants came in and out. An old man was reading an old book about the ice-hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Drinking my black iced tea, I sat near a table of a Bosnian couple, speaking Bosnian. The cafe music was multilingual, and I could hear Mexican lyrics,\"Llorando, llorando, llorando\": \"Crying, crying, crying.\" An old man who was a regular before and had moved to White Rock gave me a little KitKat chocolate bar, wrapped in red paper. In the afternoon, I returned to the packed pizzeria to enjoy a pesto cheese slice and iced black diet cola. I could not sit in my usual corner.

PIE was the great-great-grandfather of languages like Spanish, English, German, Welsh, Hindi, Greek, and many others today. Adil and I discuss about some modern humans who have genes from other species, like the Neanderthals and Denisovans. Scientists know that the brain size of the Neanderthal was bigger than the modern human's.",
        "In the late 1990s, I inherited an expensive black Australian Outback jacket from a slightly corpulent homestay Japanese student Hirotada, who stayed in my home on Lulu Island for five years. He was going to a college to learn English. It is really difficult for most Japanese to learn English, because the structure and usage are so different. They seldom fraternize with native Anglophones, because of an entirely different culture.",

        "Today in the blue-sky morning of the 2nd of July of 2022, walking back from a Lulu Island corner convenience store, I saw Michael the Dane-French. He said that he was fighting nicotine. Then, he said that it struck him to find out that I have been a great traveller of this world. \"I've seen everything!\" I boasted. Michael said that the best thing is \"great literature whilst travelling.\" As a musician, Michael himself has travelled across North America, the Caribbean, and Mexico. He said that he has never been to Europe. \"It's a whole different planet!\" I said.",
        "On the 3rd of February of 2012, I started actively learning Interlingua, the 1951 vintage created language, using the exciting Euro-based Tatoeba translation project on the Web. Some friends there suggested that this Blue Tongue was the one suited for me. I ventured to the Lulu Island neighbourhood Roman Catholic church, St. Paul's, on some mornings to enjoy the spiritual brown 1960s architecture and to mix with people who thought about Heaven. At this time, I considered myself as having committed to no specific religion, I believing that spirituality was utterly different from religiosity. I still preferred to blend what I know of different religions, although for a long time, it was really generic Animism and non-sect Buddhism which had the greatest impact on me. I thought now that it was better not to proclaim membership to a particular religion, though. People around me still preferred \"shrink-wrapped\" religions right off the shelves of the Religion Store.",
        "Whilst I was drinking my medium-sized iced green tea at the cafe, Hans the Netherlander rolled in through the entrance in his wheelchair. He gave me a little piece of sugarless candy. He ordered coffee. He said that he was going to celebrate his friend's birthday at the Greek restaurant Kisamos Taverna in Steveston village, here on Lulu Island, at 6 PM, today the 28th of October of 2021. He called for a taxi. I once ate moussaka in that restaurant. I said that I remembered when Steveston was not so touristy and my mother worked in the bank there in the 1970s. Apparently, his daughter works at the bank there. Meanwhile, a big handsome white man came in through the entrance, then went in and out of the washroom, then took a coffee cup from the counter, then exited the cafe. I then said that I had to go. Hans decided that he would take the bus, instead of waiting for the taxi.",

I suppose some people at the teahouse miss the noisy patois of Taglish of Greg and me. I was just reading my Japanese-language fantasy book Tabi no Nakama, or The Fellowship of the Ring, of the famous J.R.R. Tolkien.

The big screen was showing news from Seattle, with the sound off, as usual. On my way home, on the main road, I noticed that some trees or bushes were already blooming with yellow and pink flowers.

Later, my Cantonese friend Gary showed up; his family has been in this country for generations. Besides English, he speaks Cantonese and Mandarin. Some people want to live in a different country: Gary wants to live in Vietnam, specifically Ho Chi Minh City, for part of the year, as he has a girlfriend there. He said that he was not having too much language difficulty there, despite that I know that most signs there are in Vietnamese. He suggested that I buy property in the Philippines, where it would be much cheaper. I said that I do not really prefer a Xtian country. I talked about the city of Ayutthaya in Buddhist Thailand, full of expatriates admiring ancient temples there. Later, before 8 in that morning, I walked to Starbucks, and I waited for my Filipino friend Greg, but he did not show up this time. I was drinking an iced strawberry oat matcha latte.

        "Greg and I, both Filipinos, talk at the Lulu Island café this morning of the 20th of August of 2022. I tell him of my visit to the dried mango factory estate owned by my friend's relatives in Cebu, Philippines. There was a big house near the expanses of the dried mango factory. There was a games house. The auntie looked like an affable Chinese Hispanic. My friends and I ate mangoes every day. I tell Greg of my stay in Japan, where I frequently took the trains and subways. He mentions \"bullet trains.\" I tell him that the PRC now has bullet trains. I tell him of Spanish-looking classmates with very long full names in my private school of La Salle Green Hills in Metro Manila. My classmate Julio lived in a big Spanish-style mansion with a garden driveway through the middle front. That look inspired my childhood dream that I told my mother about a \"big house on a lot with a highway in the middle on an island.\" Oh, maybe, it was from James Bond.",

I read that one of the ways a Buddhist monk could attain more enlightenment was if he lived in a cemetery. For me, having moved from Vancouver to Lulu Island was like moving to a cemetery. In fact, I am an Animist-Buddhist.",

Then, they visited Aberdeen Centre, wherein Rex bought me four packages of varied Japanese goodies: There is a small box of \"ZEN Gardening Kit\" amongst them. The others are snacks. Rex knows that I am a Nipponophile. I opine that Rex looks more Peruvian than Mexican. At home, they brought me a steamed pork-stuffed bun and lotus leaf-wrapped meat-stuffed sticky rice. Being highly cultured, Rex was preparing fruitcake with wine. Mama, Eve, and Rex huddled themselves at the kitchen table. In the meanwhile, in the evening, I went to Starbucks café to drink a reddish Passion Tango iced tea. The baristas were Chris the Japanese-English hybrid and Jessica the petite Vietnamese. I told Jessica about me eating out at Crab Hot Lau, a Vietnamese restaurant, the other day. She said that she has not tried it herself.",
        "In the early morning of the 27th of March of 2022, I was not the usual pizza junkie. I drank iced black tea and ate barbecued potato chips at the Lulu Island cafe. Two noisy Cantonese men were present. Outside, near the park, I saw a large orange thermos in a shopping cart. Some were promoting the Orange Dream, the fantasy of an Oriental conlang. Walking on, I encountered the French-Canadian Alex with his friendly Chocolate Labrador, Ellie. I reminded myself that there was also the Chocolate Dream of a fantasy conlang. In the late morning, I went to the pizzeria to eat two slices and drink a cold diet cola. I found out that Rose, the Filipina vendor, was about 9 or 10 years younger than me, so she alerted me that I should not use the Tagalog \"po\" reverential grammatical particle to her. My third walk took me to the pizzeria in the evening. I was drinking just cold diet cola, as I was watching the 94th Oscars on the big screen with sound off. Three young Filipinas came in to order. Later, I peeked into the new Japanesque SunTea Bakery, and the Purple Yam Mochi Soft Bread, selling at \"9.5\" Canadian dollars each, intrigued me. I might try it someday.

The big screen television was blank. The place was silent. The vendor was an East Indian from Mumbai, not the usual Rose the Filipina, as it was the case on Mondays and Saturdays. As I was homebound, a mesomorphic man in black outpaced me, as he mumbled a song, of which language I was not certain.",

In the Philippines, there was the Martianesque red-soil vastness of Don José Heights in Quezon City. In BC, there were the dirt mounds on the unbuilt school grounds of Rideau Park on Lulu Island. Red poppies grew in the brown earth. It was then the debut of the Star Wars franchise; I imagined Jawas might have lurked in the mounds. There were impromptu mountain bike tracks in the mounds.",

His last city was Mumbai, before he left for BC. His daughter has been left with her grandparents in India. Afroz lives with his wife, a caregiver, in Vancouver. Afroz has an MBA from India, but he says that it is difficult to attain his dream job of doing marketing. I told him that my Auntie Vicky from the Philippines was working as a manager for Tupperware (a plastic container company) in India, as she lived in a \"palace\" with servants. I could not visit her at that time because I was working. (She also worked in Thailand, which I did visit.) It is the 8th of December of 2024, today.",

He talks to me, whilst I munch on salted vinegar potato chips with iced black tea, beside a favourite Spanish-language sci-fi book, Crónicas de Majipur, by Robert Silverberg. Rod believes that there is \"one God,\" but I say that God could be either singular or plural, as number is a limitation on God. I wonder if he is a \"pantheist\" or \"panpsychist,\" who believes that there is, at some level, the divine or the mind, respectively, in everybody and everything, even a \"pillow.\" The terminology excites him. He shows me a video describing the complex Aztec calendar on his smartphone. The presentation is full of Aztec, aka Nahuatl, words, which he mistakes for \"Mayan.\" I tell him that in ancient Mexico, the Aztecs were more like the Japanese, whilst the Maya were more like the Chinese. I utter some words presented in Nahuatl. He does not look too surprised that I know how to pronounce. We both have visited Mexico before.",

This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it. Later, walking, I reached Starbucks café. I drank an Iced Gingerbread Oat Chai, then a reddish Passion Tango iced tea, from my barista Emma, an Iranian. At my corner window table, I was reading the Esperanto sci-fi book La Imperio Ornaks.",

Secondly, I ate a sausage egg English muffin meal, including a hash brown and oat milk iced coffee. I went to Starbucks for an oat nog latte. I missed Greg, my Filipino friend, who left just before me. Then, I went to Yummy Slice pizzeria for a red-can Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The Filipina vendor Rose was there, so we said \"Happy New Year\" to each other. I passed by Kin's Farm fruteria. On my way home, in the park's alleyway, I met and talked with my ufologist friend, Michael J., a Dane-French. He amused himself with the red touque on my head, with orange letters in Tagalog: \"MGA AWSTRALYA ANG MGA ESTRELYA\" (The stars are Australias). I told him it was about \"space colonization.\" There are the cold and hot deserts of other worlds. Then, I went to the house of my \"auntie\" neighbour, Tita Zeny, to pick up her homemade \"dinuguán\" or Filipino pork blood stew to bring home. Lunch at home would include Filipino chicken \"adobo.",

Greg by then had already finished his coffee, and I had just ordered my Iced Black Tea. Greg bought two bags of Dried Apple Chips, one of which he gave generously to me. We discussed in Tagalog many things like the romanticization of history, Inuit, Cree Indians, Alberta where he lived before, and evolution. Greg still did not believe in evolution, and I mentioned the Filipino creation myth in which from bamboo out came a man and a woman. We both learned this legend in school. I went to the pizzeria to have a slice and a Diet Coke. The owner, the Sri Lankan Tamil named Tharsan, was at the cashier. He lived in Vancouver, not here on Lulu Island. He had a girlfriend, also Sri Lankan. At my table, I read a Japanese fantasy book, Kudaketa Monshou, or Crumbled Coat of Arms. In my red fanny pack, I also had an Esperanto Mini Dictionary.",

Then, I walked to Starbucks. My baristas were Nicole the Filipina and Jessica the Vietnamese. I was drinking a Brown Sugar Oat Cortado that comes in a cute, little ceramic mug. It tasted like jackfruit to me. Jessica from afar whispered loudly and solemnly, \"Richmond is not like Asia.\" A regular, a big white man with white hair, sat with his tablet computer at a table near the washrooms.

One of our last meetings in the neighbourhood was at the Rideau School field. We discussed plenty. Russia and China had been \"State Capitalist\" regimes and not \"Communist\" as they claimed to be. There was an alien \"spacecraft\" hovering invisibly above the grassy field; oh no, it was some kind of \"portal\"; oh no, it was an \"incorporeal being.\" Many East Asian logograms, or \"Sinograms,\" had a categorizing radical along with a hinting phonetic radical; they were not all pictographic. Daoists, I said, liked to be like a simple driftwood. There were aliens aplenty, Bratislav repeated. That day on the field last month, the thousands of dandelions were abundant with cloudy tufts of their soon-to-fly seeds.",
        "In the morning of the 5th of September of 2022, at the Lulu Island café, Greg and I discuss sociopolitical and anthropological issues. Firstly, Greg shows me his brown pocket Modern-English Bible. I tell him that I have a big purple Tagalog Bible and a dark-blue pocket Jehovah's Witnesses' Tagalog Bible. We both know that in both English and Tagalog, there are various versions of the Bible. Then we talk about Alaska, once Russian territory, and the big Mississippi River Basin, once French territory. I tell Greg about the teleseries, Anash and the Legacy of the Sun-Rock, about the life of native Tlingit tribespeople in contact with Russians in southern Alaska and northern BC. I know that not just in BC, there are handsome hybrid children from Europeans and First Nations mixing. We talk about Brazil, which, I say, has three main blending peoples, whites, reds, and blacks. The Philippines is different from Brazil, where there are Nordics, not just Mediterraneans, amongst whites. There are Mexican-looking Filipinos in the café. From my Filipino friend Chris S., a linguist, I hear about a \"Mexipino Fest\" held on the 3rd of this month in Santa Cruz in California, as Filipinos and Mexicans celebrated their rich cultures. I may want to be a \"Mexipino,\" so I should practice my Spanish, of which I do know a lot already. I am reading Bram Stoker's Drácula in Spanish, as Halloween approaches.

I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish).

They both have Chinese and East Indian ancestries, as the daughter Sandra, whilst they all have a Fijian-nationality background. Also from Fiji, Moli's husband Leong is Chinese. Sandra's son, Moli's grandson, Darius, who has also the added Negro ancestry, a resulting quadriracial then of Mongoloid, Caucasoid, Negroid, and Australoid, has just got a job in a big boxing warehouse facility, thanks to connections with our Greek-Cypriot neighbour George, whose wife is the Japanese Chika. I talked mainly with Chika in the party in our encoded Japanese-English. The sashimi from Banzai restaurant were really \"big.\" One of her daughters was there, whilst the other was \"shopping in Metrotown.\" I know that they speak Japanese.

In the Philippines, my native Tagalog from childhood has Spanish words embedded in it. I eventually took Spanish at university in BC. I had introductory French in Grade 5 on Lulu Island, continued it in high school, then in post-secondary education. I have learned the rest autodidactically. I have reading strength in my languages, but not much in speaking, except in Esperanto, in which I have attained a high level, partly due to my participation in various clubs. I enjoy reading novels in the different languages, especially in the genres of science fiction and fantasy, as I immerse myself in far-flung worlds.

I walked to Yummy Slice pizzeria. Rose the Filipina vendor was there. I was drinking a red-can Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. (I ought to mention that I ate a slice of green pesto pizza. And I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table.) A Japanese likens my situation to a vast deserted café in Chiangmai, Thailand.

        "Even though, in the capitalist system, I made money, I don't really believe in it. I still believe, as I did in high school, in some form of communism. A society that primarily worries about money is a dysfunctional society. All people need is decent health care, decent housing, decent transportation, decent education, decent food, decent whatever, etc. We don't need extravagance. Where I live, a house typically costs a million dollars or more. Why does it cost so much, here on grey-pavement parking-lot wasteland, the Flat Mountain, Lulu Island? The houses aren't even reinforced concrete structures as in Asia, but flimsy gyprock, wood, etc. Lulu Island isn't as if a suburb of Barcelona or something posh and cultural.

He said that those good ol' childhood years were the best for him, and he feels nostalgic about them. Yaroslav has been a seaman engineer for some years. He has moved to Canada, and he studies English now, Russian being his first language and Ukrainian second. His original hair was near black, but is now whitening. He has blue eyes. He still looks like a big teenager. He is a pizza delivery man now at my local pizzeria, here at Lulu Island. We both discuss many deep, intellectual things at the pizza parlour, whilst he waits to go off for a delivery. He likes reading drama books, like Tolstoy. He likes drama movies, too. Unlike me, whose hobby is speculative fiction and astronomy, Yaroslav talks little of such things. My impression of Soviets were that they were all space-savvy. But he did mention once that within 1000 years, humanity will have to be really serious about space travel and out-of-Earth colonization, because our own Earth may fall into decay. I think that he tried to paraphrase Stephen Hawking the physicist. Yaroslav does not know Star Trek too well. I talked to him about teleportation, which scientists around the world are researching. They think that teleportation is not impossible.",

He gleefully cited the word \"fix\" as a true Anglo-Saxon word, which I negated, indicating that it really derived from the Latin \"fīgere.\" He knew that as a Filipino, I had also Roman ancestors.

A castle-like house stands in the corner. When I returned home, I opened my delivered parcel of a grey-green stone Godzilla. How wonderful it looks! On my mind now, Latinate artificial languages may have advantages over those that are not Latinate. I am thinking of Esperanto and Interlingua. Even natural languages like Tagalog and Japanese are full of international Latinate terms. (In Japanese, they are written in Katakana glyphs. It is fun to read a Japanese menu full of French and Italian food names written in Katakana. And I find it easier to read Japanese books in the sci-fi genre, because they are full of Katakana words derived from English and other languages. (Japanese is a cosmopolitan language.))

For decades now, there have existed other Latinate conlangs, different projects. And in the future, some hope for others. But it has been the Green Dream, Esperanto, that has succeeded for more than a century. Reforms attempted upon Esperanto have met with failure over the decades because genuine Esperanto has an artistic balance with which one cannot tamper. Esperanto remains enduring. Amongst the Blues, my vote is still Interlingua. More people should give it a chance. Esperanto's accents give a charm to the language that perhaps boosted its survival over the years. There are substitute systems.",

In the Philippines, my native Tagalog from childhood has Spanish words embedded in it. I eventually took Spanish at university in BC. I had introductory French in Grade 5 on Lulu Island, continued it in high school, then in post-secondary education. I have learned the rest autodidactically. I have reading strength in my languages, but not much in speaking, except in Esperanto, in which I have attained a high level, partly due to my participation in various clubs. I enjoy reading novels in the different languages, especially in the genres of science fiction and fantasy, as I immerse myself in far-flung worlds.

But since jumping was no easy matter on Neptune, the cat-like types were all minute. They preyed upon man's more rabbit-like and rat-like descendants, or on the carrion of the larger mammals, or on the lusty worms and beetles. These had sprung originally from vermin which had been transported accidentally from Venus. For of all the ancient Venerian fauna only man himself, a few insects and other invertebrates, and many kinds of micro-organisms, succeeded in colonizing Neptune. Of plants, many types had been artificially bred for the new world, and from these eventually arose a host of grasses, flowering plants, thick-trunked bushes, and novel sea-weeds. On this marine flora fed certain highly developed marine worms; and of these last, some in time became vertebrate, predatory, swift and fish-like. On these in turn man's own marine descendants preyed, whether as sub-human seals, or still more specialized subhuman porpoises."

They went to Garden City Shopping Centre to have bubble tea that he has been desiring. Then, they visited Aberdeen Centre, wherein Rex bought me four packages of varied Japanese goodies: There is a small box of \"ZEN Gardening Kit\" amongst them. The others are snacks. Rex knows that I am a Nipponophile. I opine that Rex looks more Peruvian than Mexican. At home, they brought me a steamed pork-stuffed bun and lotus leaf-wrapped meat-stuffed sticky rice. Being highly cultured, Rex was preparing fruitcake with wine. Mama, Eve, and Rex huddled themselves at the kitchen table. In the meanwhile, in the evening, I went to Starbucks café to drink a reddish Passion Tango iced tea. The baristas were Chris the Japanese-English hybrid and Jessica the petite Vietnamese. I told Jessica about me eating out at Crab Hot Lau, a Vietnamese restaurant, the other day. She said that she has not tried it herself.",

My individual order was the Number 8: barbecued pork with vermicelli. I enjoyed also the square crab spring rolls. My mother made mango bars, which she brought to the restaurant for our dessert. Near the restaurant was the Serra Bar Café, a Portuguese establishment. It was the 25th of December of 2024, \"Krismas\" and the first day of Hanukkah.",

At the Subway sandwitcheria, I got a Turkey Ranch \"Snackwich\" with spinach, tomatoes, fried onions, cucumbers, and honey mustard sauce. Simran the Punjabi Sikh was my vendor.

Greg still did not believe in evolution, and I mentioned the Filipino creation myth in which from bamboo out came a man and a woman. We both learned this legend in school.

For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013."

At our house, Rex, the cousin of my cousin Eve, arrived from the states. A devout Roman Catholic Filipino, he was wearing a necklace with a hanging crucifix when he greeted me. I exclaimed \"Mr. Lingo!\": Like I, he has been a long-time language fanatic, and now he is learning Portuguese and Polish. He knows that my \"favourite\" is Esperanto. He amused himself with my dark red T-shirt with the vertical phrase in white letters in Spanish: \"¡Las estrellas son Australias!\" (\"The stars are Australias!\" about outer space and potential future colonies on the cold and hot desert worlds beyond our Earth). I was wearing also a red baseball cap with yellow lettering of \"XANADU, TITAN\": a reference to a mystical region on Saturn's moon.

In return, Mama has me give them Swiss chard and three green poblanos, grown by my elder brother Fernando in Vancouver. Moli has given us her exotic cooking. In Moli's kitchen, her husband Leong and she are watching a Sunday church television show. I know that the Wongs are Catholic, but the show is not. In the corner of Moli's kitchen is fully decorated with Fijian masks, etc., which intrigue me, being an art collector myself. I talk with her grownup kids Sandra and Isaac. The Wongs resemble Japanese to me. Sandra and Isaac will be visiting Western Europe in September. Sandra and Moli have previously been to Greece. I recount my experience there with amazing whitewashed buildings with blue roofs. I say to them that some Japanese fantasize to live in a Mediterranean village. I say that some of my Greek-Jew ancestors from Greece settled in Panama, so I have relatives there today. My great-grandfather instead went to the Philippines. Sandra has visited Costa Rica. We agree that tourists should not be so \"snooty\" and should learn some of the local lingo. Such makes friendlier relations.

I recount my experience there with amazing whitewashed buildings with blue roofs. I say to them that some Japanese fantasize to live in a Mediterranean village. I say that some of my Greek-Jew ancestors from Greece settled in Panama, so I have relatives there today. My great-grandfather instead went to the Philippines. Sandra has visited Costa Rica.

Then, I went to the cafe, where there was a long line. In front of me was a big boy in shorts, his meaty legs showing. A stocky man in a grey T-shirt and black track pants came in and out. An old man was reading an old book about the ice-hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Drinking my black iced tea, I sat near a table of a Bosnian couple, speaking Bosnian. The cafe music was multilingual, and I could hear Mexican lyrics,\"Llorando, llorando, llorando\": \"Crying, crying, crying.\" An old man who was a regular before and had moved to White Rock gave me a little KitKat chocolate bar, wrapped in red paper. In the afternoon, I returned to the packed pizzeria to enjoy a pesto cheese slice and iced black diet cola. I could not sit in my usual corner.

He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111)."

Each beam will consist of nearly 3,000 bunches, with each bunch containing as many as 100 billion particles. When head-on collisions occur, they will produce a shower of new particles. But the most interesting new particles will be very rare events.",

        "Whilst drinking my Oat Nog Latte at Starbucks café, this grey-sky morning, I was talking to Afroz, a worker at Kin's Farm Market on Lulu Island, which I frequent to buy exotic things (to others) like lotus roots, Japanese yams, kumquats, dragonfruits, longans, jujubes, Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes, passion fruits, star fruits, etc. Afroz is what he categorizes himself as a \"generic Indian Muslim.\" He was from Uttar Pradesh. His last city was Mumbai, before he left for BC. His daughter has been left with her grandparents in India. Afroz lives with his wife, a caregiver, in Vancouver. Afroz has an MBA from India, but he says that it is difficult to attain his dream job of doing marketing. I told him that my Auntie Vicky from the Philippines was working as a manager for Tupperware (a plastic container company) in India, as she lived in a \"palace\" with servants. I could not visit her at that time because I was working. (She also worked in Thailand, which I did visit.) It is the 8th of December of 2024, today."

(I am not really sure if he is Greek, but I heard him talking in his cellphone in a language that sounded Greek to me.) I took my second walk in the grey-sky morning: At Yummy Slice pizzeria, Sachet the Gujarati vendor and Tharsan the Sri Lankan owner were there, as I was drinking my grey-can Diet Coke. At the Subway sandwitcheria, I got a Turkey Ranch \"Snackwich\" with spinach, tomatoes, fried onions, cucumbers, and honey mustard sauce. Simran the Punjabi Sikh was my vendor. She talked about the coming Lohri Festival in January for Punjabis. It has to do with celebrating with bonfires and honouring childbirth. I greeted Don the head-shaven white man at Starbucks café, where I was eating almonds. Today is the 9th of December of 2024."

As I entered Starbucks café, sitting at a table with two Doritos bags of chips, one purple and one red, were Peter the redheaded Anglo and Hans the Netherlander on a motorized wheelchair, who offered to me. I took a few chips from both bags. Then, I was drinking reddish Passion Tango iced tea, then Oat Nog Latte. I was munching on crème brûlée almonds. I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish). I said that it was \"rāmen.\" Homebound, walking, I accidentally tripped on a wooden board in a dark alleyway. My eyeglasses fell off. Luckily, I was not hurt. A Cantonese labourer helped me. Today is the 14th of December of 2024."

My individual order was the Number 8: barbecued pork with vermicelli. I enjoyed also the square crab spring rolls. My mother made mango bars, which she brought to the restaurant for our dessert. Near the restaurant was the Serra Bar Café, a Portuguese establishment. It was the 25th of December of 2024, \"Krismas\" and the first day of Hanukkah."
