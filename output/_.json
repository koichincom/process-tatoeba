Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility.

He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

        "The analysis of gender in religion or spirituality is an esoteric theme. I for one am attracted to Buddhism, because of its masculine viewpoint about reality. Buddhists accept prevailing discontent as a condition of this illusory world, the Māyā hiding true reality, but paradoxically, they promote equanimous joy. They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so. Some sci-fi buff friends of mine think that all I need is sci-fi as an exercise in understanding reality through irreality, something I have been doing since reading Dr. Seuss imaginary books in Grade 1. I analyse that it may have been originally Dr. Seuss books that encouraged me to pursue the sci-fi imaginarium throughout my life.

I have heard theories that in ancient Pre-Columbian times, Pacific Islanders made voyages reaching as far as the Pacific coasts of the Americas. I believe such did happen. So, there were likely contacts between Polynesian tribes and Amerindian tribes. \"Linguistic Evidence for a Prehistoric Polynesia—Southern California Contact Event\" by Kathryn Klar and Terry L.

Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility.

I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7.

I am also thinking that a Latinate language with a blend of the indigenous may be fun and fascinating, as in the case of Philippine Creole Spanish (Chavacano (Chabacano)).",

        "These are some 10 guidelines that will help my friend to get familiar with Finnish cultures, everyday life, and customs. 1. Respect for Personal Space Finnish people value personal space by keeping a bit of distance when talking to someone. Handshakes are common greetings, but hugs are only for close friends or family. 2. Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility. Everyone is treated equally, and showing off wealth or status is not appreciated.",

I asked him if he believed in an Immortal Soul, something that Buddhism does not acknowledge because Buddhists believe we are a never-ending \"stream of consciousness,\" not really a soul. He said he believed in an Immortal Soul. Then he said that there is only One Truth and that it cannot be verbalized; it must be experienced. That's an interesting perspective indeed.

Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5.

It is a cold Green Apple Bubble Green Tea. It is delicious. I take the escalator down. On my way to the washroom, I notice a big aquarium full of probably giant red Alaskan king crabs with barnacles on their legs. They remind me of extraterrestrials, somehow. At the bookstore, I buy a heavily illustrated green botany book in sinograms. I left it on top of a box a month ago and it is still there. It is $14. I take the escalator up. Addicted to Bubble Tea, I spend my remaining coins on a cold Lychee Bubble Green Tea. It is delicious with even bits of white lychee flesh.",
        "I walked at night, here on Lulu Island. As I entered Starbucks café, sitting at a table with two Doritos bags of chips, one purple and one red, were Peter the redheaded Anglo and Hans the Netherlander on a motorized wheelchair, who offered to me. I took a few chips from both bags. Then, I was drinking reddish Passion Tango iced tea, then Oat Nog Latte. I was munching on crème brûlée almonds. I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish). I said that it was \"rāmen.\" Homebound, walking, I accidentally tripped on a wooden board in a dark alleyway. My eyeglasses fell off. Luckily, I was not hurt. A Cantonese labourer helped me.

She talked about \"spirits\" and \"ghosts.\" She talked of \"dimensions\" and \"frequencies\" concerning spiritual \"ascension.\" She was curious of the word \"divine.\" She believed in sentients on other \"planets\" in other \"solar systems\" in other \"galaxies.\" She liked astronomy and cosmology. She was very positive and believed in esoteric self-improvement. She was a rare person. In any case, she was a syncretist, as many Chinese were.",

        "Born in the time of The Beatles, my generation in the Philippines was the product of more nationalism and less Americanization than what my parents experienced, born during the Swing and Big Band music era. It was in 1937 that the Philippine government adopted Tagalog, an Austronesian language, as the basis of the national language. Filipinos born during the time of \"King of Pop\" Michael Jackson had much more Tagalog indoctrination, and television shows, anime, and cinema became more Tagalog. Later Filipinos born during the reign of Lady Gaga became more exposed to the Internet, where English was ubiquitous. With floodgates open, the archipelagic nation once again became inundated with the colonial language. It still seemed though that the reading habit was not for the majority because most books there were in English, which the elite gobbled up. The Philippines was a country of about 200 native Austronesian languages, whose ancient origin was Taiwan. What school children learned was Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English, but Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two languages, was the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands. English was the main written language.",

However, the de facto aural-oral lingua franca in the archipelago is Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two official languages, Filipino (Tagalog essentially) and English.

Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility.

He declared that one didn't need \"salvation\" from anything, like from \"sin\" as in Christianity, or like from \"suffering\" as in Buddhism. I asked him if he believed in an Immortal Soul, something that Buddhism does not acknowledge because Buddhists believe we are a never-ending \"stream of consciousness,\" not really a soul. He said he believed in an Immortal Soul. Then he said that there is only One Truth and that it cannot be verbalized; it must be experienced. That's an interesting perspective indeed.

        "As stated above, Gadolinite was discovered by Arrhenius in 1788. Geijer examined it in the same year, and described it as a black zeolite. In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

        "The analysis of gender in religion or spirituality is an esoteric theme. I for one am attracted to Buddhism, because of its masculine viewpoint about reality. Buddhists accept prevailing discontent as a condition of this illusory world, the Māyā hiding true reality, but paradoxically, they promote equanimous joy. They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so. Some sci-fi buff friends of mine think that all I need is sci-fi as an exercise in understanding reality through irreality, something I have been doing since reading Dr. Seuss imaginary books in Grade 1. I analyse that it may have been originally Dr. Seuss books that encouraged me to pursue the sci-fi imaginarium throughout my life. Some sci-fact buffs, however, incline away from sci-fi, which they may think is childish, frivolous \"hypotheticals.\" I believe also in sci-fact, invigorated by sci-fi excursions.",

The Mormons believe in polygamy. They encourage the study of extensive genealogies, so that people know their place in family. Subliminally, Mormons believe in the limitations of human intelligence.

He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it.

But biological weapons may not destroy valuable real estate. Yes, humans are still fighting primates. Racial intolerance is a sign that people still cannot live in peace.

In the afternoon, I returned to the pizzeria to have a slice and an iced diet black cola. It was Seattle news, again, on the big screen, with sound off. Somewhat audible East Indian music was playing behind the counter. A boisterous corpulent East Indian man with his boy with a rocket-ship T-shirt ordered pizza. I walked to the cafe. At the cafe, I drank iced black tea. Behind the counter was Sebastian, the Mayan-Austrian hybrid. A big mesomorphic boy customer with something like a samurai hairdo entered. I had seen him before with his impressive meaty thighs, as he liked wearing shorts. Heading home, I observed through the window the new interesting products in the new Japanesque bakery with a bubble-tea vendor. I saw an elegant long bun with the price tag \"$95\"—or \"$9.50\"?

A striking part of our conversation was about my Egyptian excursion. My early objective in life was to see the Great Pyramids, which I managed to do in my twenties. Egypt was like a different planet, with old French colonial buildings and multimillennial ruins. The sky was a deep blue over the desert.

But the immortal spark of genius, which Heaven had kindled in the infant’s bosom, was not to be extinguished by the caprice of a mistaken parent.

The Ebionites were vegetarians. There were many other extinct sects of Christianity. At that time, the distinction between Jews and Christians was not really clear-cut. Another sect that is extinct today is the Marcionites. Marcion of Sinope (circa 85-160 CE) wrote books that did not survive to the present day; one book that he wrote was The Antitheses. Unlike the Ebionites who still followed Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was human, not God, the Marcionites rejected Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was God, not human. The Marcionites believed that there were 2 gods, the Creator God of the Jews and the God of Jesus. Jesus was the God of mercy and love; he was to save people from the wrathful Creator God. \"Docetism\" is the term used for thinking that Jesus was a phantasm that appeared human.

In the sunny afternoon, going back to the pizzeria, I saw, on the other side of the main road, a whole Jewish family with children, all wearing Sabbath synagogue attire. I waved to Gurpreet the Sikh at the gasoline station. At the pizzeria's front, a thickset bicyclist in black parked and locked his bicycle. I ate a pizza slice and drank a cold diet cola.

I know that not just in BC, there are handsome hybrid children from Europeans and First Nations mixing. We talk about Brazil, which, I say, has three main blending peoples, whites, reds, and blacks. The Philippines is different from Brazil, where there are Nordics, not just Mediterraneans, amongst whites. There are Mexican-looking Filipinos in the café. From my Filipino friend Chris S., a linguist, I hear about a \"Mexipino Fest\" held on the 3rd of this month in Santa Cruz in California, as Filipinos and Mexicans celebrated their rich cultures. I may want to be a \"Mexipino,\" so I should practice my Spanish, of which I do know a lot already. I am reading Bram Stoker's Drácula in Spanish, as Halloween approaches.

Not many people that I have met feel satisfied in just being able to read in an extra language, but I do feel satisfied hearing the words in my inner mind. With varying fluency, I can read over ten languages. (I do not really count them because some are like knowledge shades.)

In Moli's kitchen, her husband Leong and she are watching a Sunday church television show. I know that the Wongs are Catholic, but the show is not. In the corner of Moli's kitchen is fully decorated with Fijian masks, etc., which intrigue me, being an art collector myself. I talk with her grownup kids Sandra and Isaac. The Wongs resemble Japanese to me. Sandra and Isaac will be visiting Western Europe in September. Sandra and Moli have previously been to Greece. I recount my experience there with amazing whitewashed buildings with blue roofs. I say to them that some Japanese fantasize to live in a Mediterranean village. I say that some of my Greek-Jew ancestors from Greece settled in Panama, so I have relatives there today. My great-grandfather instead went to the Philippines. Sandra has visited Costa Rica.

They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so. Some sci-fi buff friends of mine think that all I need is sci-fi as an exercise in understanding reality through irreality, something I have been doing since reading Dr. Seuss imaginary books in Grade 1. I analyse that it may have been originally Dr. Seuss books that encouraged me to pursue the sci-fi imaginarium throughout my life. Some sci-fact buffs, however, incline away from sci-fi, which they may think is childish, frivolous \"hypotheticals.\" I believe also in sci-fact, invigorated by sci-fi excursions."

Walking on, I encountered the French-Canadian Alex with his friendly Chocolate Labrador, Ellie. I reminded myself that there was also the Chocolate Dream of a fantasy conlang. In the late morning, I went to the pizzeria to eat two slices and drink a cold diet cola. I found out that Rose, the Filipina vendor, was about 9 or 10 years younger than me, so she alerted me that I should not use the Tagalog \"po\" reverential grammatical particle to her. My third walk took me to the pizzeria in the evening. I was drinking just cold diet cola, as I was watching the 94th Oscars on the big screen with sound off. Three young Filipinas came in to order. Later, I peeked into the new Japanesque SunTea Bakery, and the Purple Yam Mochi Soft Bread, selling at \"9.5\" Canadian dollars each, intrigued me. I might try it someday.

Secondly, I ate a sausage egg English muffin meal, including a hash brown and oat milk iced coffee. I went to Starbucks for an oat nog latte. I missed Greg, my Filipino friend, who left just before me. Then, I went to Yummy Slice pizzeria for a red-can Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The Filipina vendor Rose was there, so we said \"Happy New Year\" to each other. I passed by Kin's Farm fruteria. On my way home, in the park's alleyway, I met and talked with my ufologist friend, Michael J., a Dane-French. He amused himself with the red touque on my head, with orange letters in Tagalog: \"MGA AWSTRALYA ANG MGA ESTRELYA\" (The stars are Australias). I told him it was about \"space colonization.\" There are the cold and hot deserts of other worlds.

He said that he did not know French, when he lived in Montreal. I ate a slice of pesto cheese pizza at the pizzeria. The vendor was from Mumbai. Through the window, I could see a young brown-blond-haired man in a dark-grey hooded jacket and blue shorts, which made him look like a \"big boy.\" At the cafe, there was an under-age-30 crowd of ten outside, of whom one looked like a handsome Jew. Inside was a table of five or six over-age-30 people, of whom one was a handsome tomboy in a dark-green jacket and army-green pants. I drank my iced black tea. Heading out of the cafe, I saw the \"big boy\" smoking in the wooded park. I took the long route home, through the grassy school field littered with goose poop, the northern snowcapped mountains obscured by clouds, an Animistic-Buddhistic view seemingly of a different planet.

But it has been the Green Dream, Esperanto, that has succeeded for more than a century. Reforms attempted upon Esperanto have met with failure over the decades because genuine Esperanto has an artistic balance with which one cannot tamper. Esperanto remains enduring. Amongst the Blues, my vote is still Interlingua. More people should give it a chance. Esperanto's accents give a charm to the language that perhaps boosted its survival over the years.

They believed that humans were trapped in their bodies and in this evil material world that was created by a cosmic disaster, by a malevolent deity who was not Christ. Christian Gnostics believed that Christ was one of the aeons or divine beings from the Pleroma, the Divine Realm, as described in the Apocryphon of John, part of the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic literature. Salvation was by esoteric knowledge, although ultimately self-knowledge. Gnostics believed in the dualism of the good spirit and evil matter. The material world was an evil place from where Gnostics had to escape. They believed that not all humans had the Divine Spark. The aeons emanated from the Ultimate God, the Monad in the Pleroma. The origins of Gnosticism are unclear today, but probably it came from Persia or further east. It had a lot of Greek influences. Today, after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library as leather-bound papyrus codices in a sealed jar in Egypt, in 1945, some people are trying to revive Gnosticism. \"Gnōsis\" is Greek for knowledge.",

        "There were many kinds of early Christians. Some sects never made it to the present time. One of them was the Ebionites, from the Hebrew \"ebyonim\" for poor. They revered Jesus' supposed brother James the Just, but rejected the missionary Paul of Tarsus. They believed that Mary was not a virgin and that Jesus was adopted by God. The Ebionites were vegetarians. There were many other extinct sects of Christianity. At that time, the distinction between Jews and Christians was not really clear-cut. Another sect that is extinct today is the Marcionites. Marcion of Sinope (circa 85-160 CE) wrote books that did not survive to the present day; one book that he wrote was The Antitheses. Unlike the Ebionites who still followed Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was human, not God, the Marcionites rejected Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was God, not human. The Marcionites believed that there were 2 gods, the Creator God of the Jews and the God of Jesus. Jesus was the God of mercy and love; he was to save people from the wrathful Creator God. \"Docetism\" is the term used for thinking that Jesus was a phantasm that appeared human. Marcionites believed that Jesus was not born into this world. Their canon was something like the New Testament, but more compact, and phrases that Marcion thought were scribes' earlier modifications had been elided.",

He's an interesting fellow who really knows a lot about spiritual affairs. After I bought the book, we talked for a few minutes. He told me that all religions \"failed\" in some way. He declared that one didn't need \"salvation\" from anything, like from \"sin\" as in Christianity, or like from \"suffering\" as in Buddhism. I asked him if he believed in an Immortal Soul, something that Buddhism does not acknowledge because Buddhists believe we are a never-ending \"stream of consciousness,\" not really a soul. He said he believed in an Immortal Soul. Then he said that there is only One Truth and that it cannot be verbalized; it must be experienced. That's an interesting perspective indeed.

At the Subway sandwitcheria, I got a Turkey Ranch \"Snackwich\" with spinach, tomatoes, fried onions, cucumbers, and honey mustard sauce. Simran the Punjabi Sikh was my vendor.

Manila was the 9th largest Spanish-speaking city in this world in 1930 with 324 552 inhabitants. The switch to English for at least written communication was set in motion. Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media. Spanish embedded itself as many natural-sounding loanwords within Tagalog, Taglish, and other native languages. Tagalog had not been fully \"intellectualized\" as a language, as many great international works had not been translated into it.

By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school.

The Philippines was a country of about 200 native Austronesian languages, whose ancient origin was Taiwan.

As time passed, code-switching between English and indigenous languages became more prevalent. As a result, the Philippines is a linguistic hodgepodge. English is like an effervescent pink drink, and Tagalog is a grey shark in the seas. Spanish still rings nostalgically of bygone majestic good ol' days for many Filipinos.

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

I said that he could have taken up some other \"habits.\" Then the conversation switched to the topic of Mexican cuisine and its hidden variety. I had pizza and diet black soda at the pizzeria, where there were some South Asians, as clients and vendor, as well as a Cockney-accented white man.

I saw my big neighbour in a grey jacket and black pants, as he looked like promenading fat Maitreya Buddha. At the cafe, drinking my iced black tea, I chatted with the brunette barista Sarah from Montreal about how the cherry blossoms seemed late this year. I went to the quiet pizzeria, and Rose the Filipina was unusually there on a Saturday. Eating pizza, her son John-Paul was there, who did not want to go to martial-arts class today, because of feeling too lazy. I ate a slice and drank cold diet cola.",

When I heard from afar people speaking either of these two languages, I often mistook it for the other. These languages were funny in the way the vowels \"squished\" or \"bloated\" like rubber, depending if they were unstressed or stressed. Afterwards, I ate chocolate-laced Italian biscotti. In the drizzling morning after 10 o'clock, I walked to the pizzeria. On the way, on the other side of the main road, running in the opposite direction, was a little stocky boy with dark hair. At the pizzeria, I ate two slices and drank a diet black cola. A couple of city punks with a skateboard visited the Lulu Island suburban pizza parlour. A basketball game was in progress on the big screen, with the sound off.

I had a Hawaiian slice and iced tea. Then, I went to the grocery store looking for dried anchovies, but there was none, according to the two Filipina workers there, so I bought instead five packets of frozen crab-flavoured wild pollock, or kamaboko, and a bag of frozen sole fillets. Then, I went to the cafe, where there was a long line. In front of me was a big boy in shorts, his meaty legs showing. A stocky man in a grey T-shirt and black track pants came in and out. An old man was reading an old book about the ice-hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Drinking my black iced tea, I sat near a table of a Bosnian couple, speaking Bosnian. The cafe music was multilingual, and I could hear Mexican lyrics,\"Llorando, llorando, llorando\": \"Crying, crying, crying.\" An old man who was a regular before and had moved to White Rock gave me a little KitKat chocolate bar, wrapped in red paper. In the afternoon, I returned to the packed pizzeria to enjoy a pesto cheese slice and iced black diet cola. I could not sit in my usual corner. There were multiracial girl students, with expensive bubble teas. Outside near the greengrocery, white students walked by, saying, \"We rather have salvation from suffering.\" It was drizzling.",

A striking part of our conversation was about my Egyptian excursion. My early objective in life was to see the Great Pyramids, which I managed to do in my twenties. Egypt was like a different planet, with old French colonial buildings and multimillennial ruins. The sky was a deep blue over the desert.

Facing away, at the counter, the thinner one, still waiting for his order, sat to the left of the thicker one, already devouring his pizza. From his pizza, the thicker one handed the other a pineapple chunk, which he gulped. Metaphorically, they were like Lojban and Esperanto, or Animism and Buddhism, maybe.

        "Greg and I, both Filipinos, talk at the Lulu Island café this morning of the 20th of August of 2022. I tell him of my visit to the dried mango factory estate owned by my friend's relatives in Cebu, Philippines. There was a big house near the expanses of the dried mango factory. There was a games house. The auntie looked like an affable Chinese Hispanic. My friends and I ate mangoes every day. I tell Greg of my stay in Japan, where I frequently took the trains and subways. He mentions \"bullet trains.\" I tell him that the PRC now has bullet trains. I tell him of Spanish-looking classmates with very long full names in my private school of La Salle Green Hills in Metro Manila. My classmate Julio lived in a big Spanish-style mansion with a garden driveway through the middle front. That look inspired my childhood dream that I told my mother about a \"big house on a lot with a highway in the middle on an island.\" Oh, maybe, it was from James Bond.",

        "In the early morning of the 27th of March of 2022, I was not the usual pizza junkie. I drank iced black tea and ate barbecued potato chips at the Lulu Island cafe. Two noisy Cantonese men were present. Outside, near the park, I saw a large orange thermos in a shopping cart. Some were promoting the Orange Dream, the fantasy of an Oriental conlang. Walking on, I encountered the French-Canadian Alex with his friendly Chocolate Labrador, Ellie. I reminded myself that there was also the Chocolate Dream of a fantasy conlang. In the late morning, I went to the pizzeria to eat two slices and drink a cold diet cola. I found out that Rose, the Filipina vendor, was about 9 or 10 years younger than me, so she alerted me that I should not use the Tagalog \"po\" reverential grammatical particle to her. My third walk took me to the pizzeria in the evening. I was drinking just cold diet cola, as I was watching the 94th Oscars on the big screen with sound off. Three young Filipinas came in to order. Later, I peeked into the new Japanesque SunTea Bakery, and the Purple Yam Mochi Soft Bread, selling at \"9.5\" Canadian dollars each, intrigued me. I might try it someday. The vendors spoke Mandarin.",

He talks to me, whilst I munch on salted vinegar potato chips with iced black tea, beside a favourite Spanish-language sci-fi book, Crónicas de Majipur, by Robert Silverberg. Rod believes that there is \"one God,\" but I say that God could be either singular or plural, as number is a limitation on God. I wonder if he is a \"pantheist\" or \"panpsychist,\" who believes that there is, at some level, the divine or the mind, respectively, in everybody and everything, even a \"pillow.\" The terminology excites him. He shows me a video describing the complex Aztec calendar on his smartphone. The presentation is full of Aztec, aka Nahuatl, words, which he mistakes for \"Mayan.\" I tell him that in ancient Mexico, the Aztecs were more like the Japanese, whilst the Maya were more like the Chinese. I utter some words presented in Nahuatl. He does not look too surprised that I know how to pronounce. We both have visited Mexico before.",

I didn't believe in bringing children into this world of dissatisfaction. I said that some people wanted children as a kind of \"fake\" immortality. Personality forms from both genes and environment, so even a clone brother would eventually have a different personality. Simar said that in the eastern part India, there were many Buddhists. I said that I knew a bit of Indian history, in that at one time, India was mostly Buddhist, but later, Hinduism reabsorbed Buddhism, and Hinduism became dominant once again. Simar was interested that I had been a software engineer in three different countries. Simar never tried the fruit durian, which I explained had a controversial odour, but was a luxury fruit of buttery texture to Orientals.",
        "In the morning of the 5th of September of 2022, at the Lulu Island café, Greg and I discuss sociopolitical and anthropological issues. Firstly, Greg shows me his brown pocket Modern-English Bible. I tell him that I have a big purple Tagalog Bible and a dark-blue pocket Jehovah's Witnesses' Tagalog Bible. We both know that in both English and Tagalog, there are various versions of the Bible. Then we talk about Alaska, once Russian territory, and the big Mississippi River Basin, once French territory. I tell Greg about the teleseries, Anash and the Legacy of the Sun-Rock, about the life of native Tlingit tribespeople in contact with Russians in southern Alaska and northern BC. I know that not just in BC, there are handsome hybrid children from Europeans and First Nations mixing. We talk about Brazil, which, I say, has three main blending peoples, whites, reds, and blacks. The Philippines is different from Brazil, where there are Nordics, not just Mediterraneans, amongst whites. There are Mexican-looking Filipinos in the café. From my Filipino friend Chris S., a linguist, I hear about a \"Mexipino Fest\" held on the 3rd of this month in Santa Cruz in California, as Filipinos and Mexicans celebrated their rich cultures. I may want to be a \"Mexipino,\" so I should practice my Spanish, of which I do know a lot already. I am reading Bram Stoker's Drácula in Spanish, as Halloween approaches. I am also reading an Esperanto book, Memoraĵoj de kampara knabo, by Xosé Neira Vilas.",

Hans the Netherlander astronomy buff talked about the ongoing politics with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Coincidentally, a family of Russian-speaking Eurasians just from the barbershop, owned by a Middle Easterner, passed through the cafe.

We wonder if most Filipinos really have Spanish and Chinese blood. Many Filipinos don't trace their genealogy. I mention to him that as one just lands at the Manila airport, one sees that the majority are really Malay-looking people. We talk about Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. I list some countries, in four continents, to which I've travelled, as it impresses him that I am a world traveller. Greg has only been to the Philippines, Canada, and USA. I assure him that my rich uncle in Oregon, who builds houses in the Philippines, doesn't want to go to Europe. Greg knows that I've lived in Japan and Europe, where I've learned the \"walking life.",

Unlike me, whose hobby is speculative fiction and astronomy, Yaroslav talks little of such things. My impression of Soviets were that they were all space-savvy. But he did mention once that within 1000 years, humanity will have to be really serious about space travel and out-of-Earth colonization, because our own Earth may fall into decay.

After 7 in the morning, today the 26th of November of 2024, I ate a corn dog and drank a mug of hot lemon water. Before 8, I walked around and around the neighbourhood cul-de-sac. It was a grey sky. There is a house there with a front door decorated with gold-on-red \"lucky\" logograms. There are still pumpkins, a gigantic one and a mini one, in the front yard. A castle-like house stands in the corner. When I returned home, I opened my delivered parcel of a grey-green stone Godzilla. How wonderful it looks! On my mind now, Latinate artificial languages may have advantages over those that are not Latinate. I am thinking of Esperanto and Interlingua. Even natural languages like Tagalog and Japanese are full of international Latinate terms. (In Japanese, they are written in Katakana glyphs. It is fun to read a Japanese menu full of French and Italian food names written in Katakana. And I find it easier to read Japanese books in the sci-fi genre, because they are full of Katakana words derived from English and other languages. (Japanese is a cosmopolitan language.)) I am also thinking that a Latinate language with a blend of the indigenous may be fun and fascinating, as in the case of Philippine Creole Spanish (Chavacano (Chabacano)).",
        "Here on Lulu Island, a few days ago, I've tried the Jerk-spiced Chicken Rice Bowl from Subway, but I've yet to try the expensive Hawaiian goodies at Steve's Poké Bar. This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it. Later, walking, I reached Starbucks café. I drank an Iced Gingerbread Oat Chai, then a reddish Passion Tango iced tea, from my barista Emma, an Iranian. At my corner window table, I was reading the Esperanto sci-fi book La Imperio Ornaks.",

I told him it was about \"space colonization.\" There are the cold and hot deserts of other worlds. Then, I went to the house of my \"auntie\" neighbour, Tita Zeny, to pick up her homemade \"dinuguán\" or Filipino pork blood stew to bring home.

They were all South Asians. There was a fat Eurasian boy toddler with his white mama and Sinospheric papa amongst the customers. At our house, Rex, the cousin of my cousin Eve, arrived from the states. A devout Roman Catholic Filipino, he was wearing a necklace with a hanging crucifix when he greeted me. I exclaimed \"Mr. Lingo!\": Like I, he has been a long-time language fanatic, and now he is learning Portuguese and Polish. He knows that my \"favourite\" is Esperanto. He amused himself with my dark red T-shirt with the vertical phrase in white letters in Spanish: \"¡Las estrellas son Australias!\" (\"The stars are Australias!\" about outer space and potential future colonies on the cold and hot desert worlds beyond our Earth). I was wearing also a red baseball cap with yellow lettering of \"XANADU, TITAN\": a reference to a mystical region on Saturn's moon. Rex would be sojourning with my Filipino family, here on Lulu Island, for the weekend visit. He earlier communicated that he would want \"bubble tea\" from here.

I would give myself three stars out of five stars total for my Chabacano skills. I can read it quite well.

I recount my experience there with amazing whitewashed buildings with blue roofs. I say to them that some Japanese fantasize to live in a Mediterranean village. I say that some of my Greek-Jew ancestors from Greece settled in Panama, so I have relatives there today. My great-grandfather instead went to the Philippines. Sandra has visited Costa Rica.

Islam is strictly monotheistic as they believe that there is only One God, Allāh. Their sacred writings are in the Qur'an, divided into 114 suras, containing 6236 āyāt, verses. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is only perfect in the original Arabic because any translation would be deficient. Their main prophet is Muhammad, the messenger. Muslim eschatology includes bodily resurrection at the Day of Resurrection, Yawm al-Qiyāmah, when everyone will be judged for good or bad deeds. Trials and tribulation precede and coincide with al-Qiyāmah, the time of which no human knows. (I read somewhere too that in Islam, being in hell may be an impermanent condition.) Like other Abrahamicists, Muslims believe in angels. Muslims believe in predestination or divine preordainment. Muslims must pray 5 times during the day. The prayer rituals are called Ṣalāh. Like other religions, Islam has subdivisions, as the Sunni and Shia, the contention being the successor, Abu Bakr or Ali respectively, to Muhammad. (The Islamic religion's progression and overall ambiance are depicted in Frank Herbert's Dune series, which is set thousands of years from now in outer space. There is a desert planet called Arrakis.)"

Like an effervescent pink drink, English is now the main written language in the Philippines. However, the de facto aural-oral lingua franca in the archipelago is Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two official languages, Filipino (Tagalog essentially) and English. Chabacano (Chavacano) combines Spanish with native elements. There is in Chabacano no verbal conjugation that does exist in Spanish, Tagalog, and English, which complicates these languages. Native languages in the Philippines have oodles of Spanish-derived words embedded in them. Native languages are of the Austronesian family, said to have originated thousands of years ago in Taiwan. About 200 languages exist in the Philippines. Most of them are of the Austronesian family, whilst Chabacano, an outgrowth of Hispanic colonization, sprouted like mushrooms in various places there.",
        "On its way to Americanization since the Spanish-American War of 1898, in the 1930s, the Philippines was still somewhat a Hispanic country. Manila was the 9th largest Spanish-speaking city in this world in 1930 with 324 552 inhabitants. The switch to English for at least written communication was set in motion. Adding to the linguistic confusion, in 1937, the Philippine government chose Tagalog, out of about 200 native Austronesian languages, as the basis of the national language, because it was already dominant in many parts of the archipelago. By the late 20th century, Taglish, the patois of code-switching between Tagalog and English, became the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands, despite that Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English were separate studied subjects in school. English was the window to the external world, whilst Taglish became the familiar chit-chat on the streets and in the domestic media. Spanish embedded itself as many natural-sounding loanwords within Tagalog, Taglish, and other native languages. Tagalog had not been fully \"intellectualized\" as a language, as many great international works had not been translated into it. Tagalog used in non-humanities fields of science remained only experimental. Artificial Intelligence and machine translation might give Tagalog a \"kangaroo-hopping\" boost.",

I sometimes nickname the Philippines as \"Blue Hawaii.\" In any case, Tagalog seems to be strengthening in the islands, as the common person prefers to watch television in Tagalog rather than English. When I lived there in the 1970s, foreign shows were in English, but local shows in Tagalog. In recent time, American shows, Japanese anime, Korean dramas, etc. become dubbed in Tagalog. With the indigenous language, the Philippines is a highly aural-oral culture, emphasizing television, movies, videos, radio, chit-chat, etc. in lieu of much literature.",

Meanwhile, indigenous languages have continued to be the aural-oral mainstay, with Spanish loanwords being quite common. In 1937, administration chose Tagalog as the basis of the national language. As time passed, code-switching between English and indigenous languages became more prevalent. As a result, the Philippines is a linguistic hodgepodge. English is like an effervescent pink drink, and Tagalog is a grey shark in the seas. Spanish still rings nostalgically of bygone majestic good ol' days for many Filipinos. Tagalog is still not as fully \"intellectualized\" as its cousin Indonesian, which Indonesians use in university-level education and has extensive literature."

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",

My third walk took me to the pizzeria in the evening. I was drinking just cold diet cola, as I was watching the 94th Oscars on the big screen with sound off. Three young Filipinas came in to order.

        "Like Christianity and Judaism, Islam is a so-called Abrahamic religion. Muslims, as Islamic people are called, repudiate Christianity's Trinity which alludes to polytheism. Islam is strictly monotheistic as they believe that there is only One God, Allāh. Their sacred writings are in the Qur'an, divided into 114 suras, containing 6236 āyāt, verses. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is only perfect in the original Arabic because any translation would be deficient. Their main prophet is Muhammad, the messenger. Muslim eschatology includes bodily resurrection at the Day of Resurrection, Yawm al-Qiyāmah, when everyone will be judged for good or bad deeds. Trials and tribulation precede and coincide with al-Qiyāmah, the time of which no human knows. (I read somewhere too that in Islam, being in hell may be an impermanent condition.) Like other Abrahamicists, Muslims believe in angels. Muslims believe in predestination or divine preordainment. Muslims must pray 5 times during the day. The prayer rituals are called Ṣalāh. Like other religions, Islam has subdivisions, as the Sunni and Shia, the contention being the successor, Abu Bakr or Ali respectively, to Muhammad. (The Islamic religion's progression and overall ambiance are depicted in Frank Herbert's Dune series, which is set thousands of years from now in outer space. There is a desert planet called Arrakis.)"

In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin, who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth; these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy. In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed that ceria was present with the yttria. About 1838 Mosander began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that year he announced the separation of Lanthana, and in 1842 that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen months earlier. In the latter year he announced the separation of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer declared that the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels; but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration observed was probably due to that earth. The further history of these earths must be continued elsewhere (vide p. 111).",
