A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before.

Many Filipinos prefer television, cinema, or videos in an indigenous language, rather than read English, which to them is still foreign cold. Maybe, Roman letters are too rigid for their Asian eyes, unlike the ancient Baybayin script, which nowadays people relegate to tattoos and patriotic T-shirts.

Respect for Personal Space Finnish people value personal space by keeping a bit of distance when talking to someone. Handshakes are common greetings, but hugs are only for close friends or family. 2. Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility. Everyone is treated equally, and showing off wealth or status is not appreciated.",

Sandra's son, Moli's grandson, Darius, who has also the added Negro ancestry, a resulting quadriracial then of Mongoloid, Caucasoid, Negroid, and Australoid, has just got a job in a big boxing warehouse facility, thanks to connections with our Greek-Cypriot neighbour George, whose wife is the Japanese Chika. I talked mainly with Chika in the party in our encoded Japanese-English. The sashimi from Banzai restaurant were really \"big.\" One of her daughters was there, whilst the other was \"shopping in Metrotown.\" I know that they speak Japanese. I really enjoyed Moli's duck curry and chicken curry. It was a fabulous feast, here on our Lulu Island.",

        "The analysis of gender in religion or spirituality is an esoteric theme. I for one am attracted to Buddhism, because of its masculine viewpoint about reality. Buddhists accept prevailing discontent as a condition of this illusory world, the Māyā hiding true reality, but paradoxically, they promote equanimous joy. They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so.

He declared that one didn't need \"salvation\" from anything, like from \"sin\" as in Christianity, or like from \"suffering\" as in Buddhism. I asked him if he believed in an Immortal Soul, something that Buddhism does not acknowledge because Buddhists believe we are a never-ending \"stream of consciousness,\" not really a soul. He said he believed in an Immortal Soul. Then he said that there is only One Truth and that it cannot be verbalized; it must be experienced. That's an interesting perspective indeed.

He said that those good ol' childhood years were the best for him, and he feels nostalgic about them. Yaroslav has been a seaman engineer for some years. He has moved to Canada, and he studies English now, Russian being his first language and Ukrainian second. His original hair was near black, but is now whitening. He has blue eyes. He still looks like a big teenager. He is a pizza delivery man now at my local pizzeria, here at Lulu Island. We both discuss many deep, intellectual things at the pizza parlour, whilst he waits to go off for a delivery. He likes reading drama books, like Tolstoy. He likes drama movies, too. Unlike me, whose hobby is speculative fiction and astronomy, Yaroslav talks little of such things. My impression of Soviets were that they were all space-savvy. But he did mention once that within 1000 years, humanity will have to be really serious about space travel and out-of-Earth colonization, because our own Earth may fall into decay. I think that he tried to paraphrase Stephen Hawking the physicist. Yaroslav does not know Star Trek too well. I talked to him about teleportation, which scientists around the world are researching.

        "I wonder what would have been, if administrators had chosen Chabacano, Philippine Creole Spanish, as an official language in the Philippines, much as administrators had chosen Tok Pisin, an English-based creole, as an official language in Papua New Guinea. Today, Filipinos wax nostalgic and poetic of the bygone Hispanic Era. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, Puerto Rico retained Spanish, but not the Philippines. Like an effervescent pink drink, English is now the main written language in the Philippines. However, the de facto aural-oral lingua franca in the archipelago is Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two official languages, Filipino (Tagalog essentially) and English. Chabacano (Chavacano) combines Spanish with native elements. There is in Chabacano no verbal conjugation that does exist in Spanish, Tagalog, and English, which complicates these languages. Native languages in the Philippines have oodles of Spanish-derived words embedded in them. Native languages are of the Austronesian family, said to have originated thousands of years ago in Taiwan. About 200 languages exist in the Philippines. Most of them are of the Austronesian family, whilst Chabacano, an outgrowth of Hispanic colonization, sprouted like mushrooms in various places there.",

But since jumping was no easy matter on Neptune, the cat-like types were all minute. They preyed upon man's more rabbit-like and rat-like descendants, or on the carrion of the larger mammals, or on the lusty worms and beetles. These had sprung originally from vermin which had been transported accidentally from Venus. For of all the ancient Venerian fauna only man himself, a few insects and other invertebrates, and many kinds of micro-organisms, succeeded in colonizing Neptune. Of plants, many types had been artificially bred for the new world, and from these eventually arose a host of grasses, flowering plants, thick-trunked bushes, and novel sea-weeds. On this marine flora fed certain highly developed marine worms; and of these last, some in time became vertebrate, predatory, swift and fish-like.

This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it. Later, walking, I reached Starbucks café. I drank an Iced Gingerbread Oat Chai, then a reddish Passion Tango iced tea, from my barista Emma, an Iranian.

Man in these worlds sprang usually from some small opossum-like creature which had come to use the first of its three pairs of limbs for nest-building or for climbing. In time, the forepart of its body thus became erect, and it gradually assumed a form not unlike that of a quadruped with a human torso in place of a neck. In fact it became a centaur, with four legs and two capable arms. It was very strange to find oneself in a world in which all the amenities and conveniences of civilization were fashioned to suit men of this form.",

Many Filipinos do not really want to read in English, as maybe it does not attract them, so they seldom read, but instead watch television, videos, or cinema, most commonly in the indigenous language. I suspect that Roman letters do not attract some Filipinos. Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient Baybayin script, but the Unicode Standard conserves the syllabograms. Tagalog literature is not yet extensive, as is that of neighbouring Indonesia. English is like a fizzy pink soda, whilst Tagalog is like a yellow-brown cassava cake.

It was in 1937 that the Philippine government adopted Tagalog, an Austronesian language, as the basis of the national language. Filipinos born during the time of \"King of Pop\" Michael Jackson had much more Tagalog indoctrination, and television shows, anime, and cinema became more Tagalog. Later Filipinos born during the reign of Lady Gaga became more exposed to the Internet, where English was ubiquitous. With floodgates open, the archipelagic nation once again became inundated with the colonial language. It still seemed though that the reading habit was not for the majority because most books there were in English, which the elite gobbled up. The Philippines was a country of about 200 native Austronesian languages, whose ancient origin was Taiwan. What school children learned was Tagalog (alias Filipino) and English, but Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two languages, was the de facto oral-aural lingua franca in the islands.

A striking part of our conversation was about my Egyptian excursion. My early objective in life was to see the Great Pyramids, which I managed to do in my twenties.

At this time, I considered myself as having committed to no specific religion, I believing that spirituality was utterly different from religiosity. I still preferred to blend what I know of different religions, although for a long time, it was really generic Animism and non-sect Buddhism which had the greatest impact on me. I thought now that it was better not to proclaim membership to a particular religion, though.

This morning, the 25th of November of 2024, after 6, still dark as night, I saw Michael J. the Dane-French, whilst I was walking. He showed me new pictures on his cellphone about strange neighbourhood lights that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I mention to him about Elon Musk's apparent position on the matter that aliens haven't visited us here on Earth, but he doesn't discount the mathematical probability that life, intelligent or not, exists on faraway worlds. He's mentioned that there may be many one-planet civilizations that may have died out. He thinks that it is important that our Terran consciousness would be propagated outside of Earth for our own security. It's important that we have a \"multiplanetary\" civilization, Elon opines. We don't want to be a one-planet civilization that just dies out. I told Michael my two reasons that aliens would hide from us: (1) They're higher beings that have compassion for lower beings like us Earthlings, and (2) we as Terrans and Earth as a whole could be their EXPERIMENT, so they don't want to disturb it. Later, walking, I reached Starbucks café. I drank an Iced Gingerbread Oat Chai, then a reddish Passion Tango iced tea, from my barista Emma, an Iranian. At my corner window table, I was reading the Esperanto sci-fi book La Imperio Ornaks.",

I watched MTV, a music video channel that we did not have in BC, on their television. Music videos were like haiku for my generation. The Grotto, a Roman Catholic shrine, was a nice visit on top of a mountain. There were gardens and statues.",
        "At the end of last month, May of 2014, Bratislav, of Croatian descent, had left the Lulu Island neighbourhood, he having bought a new house and abandoning his slender townhouse. One of our last meetings in the neighbourhood was at the Rideau School field. We discussed plenty. Russia and China had been \"State Capitalist\" regimes and not \"Communist\" as they claimed to be. There was an alien \"spacecraft\" hovering invisibly above the grassy field; oh no, it was some kind of \"portal\"; oh no, it was an \"incorporeal being.\" Many East Asian logograms, or \"Sinograms,\" had a categorizing radical along with a hinting phonetic radical; they were not all pictographic. Daoists, I said, liked to be like a simple driftwood. There were aliens aplenty, Bratislav repeated. That day on the field last month, the thousands of dandelions were abundant with cloudy tufts of their soon-to-fly seeds.",

My reality view since childhood is that since the microcosm, my local neighbourhood, is like a desert, where life and especially intelligent life are rare and precious, then the macrocosm, comprising the worlds \"out there,\" is also desolate. My reality view has no microcosm-macrocosm dissonance. Bratislav's reality view requires review of epistemology, the study of the nature of knowledge. Who says it? From where does it come?",

We wonder if most Filipinos really have Spanish and Chinese blood. Many Filipinos don't trace their genealogy. I mention to him that as one just lands at the Manila airport, one sees that the majority are really Malay-looking people. We talk about Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. I list some countries, in four continents, to which I've travelled, as it impresses him that I am a world traveller. Greg has only been to the Philippines, Canada, and USA. I assure him that my rich uncle in Oregon, who builds houses in the Philippines, doesn't want to go to Europe. Greg knows that I've lived in Japan and Europe, where I've learned the \"walking life.",

After 7 in the morning, today the 26th of November of 2024, I ate a corn dog and drank a mug of hot lemon water. Before 8, I walked around and around the neighbourhood cul-de-sac. It was a grey sky. There is a house there with a front door decorated with gold-on-red \"lucky\" logograms. There are still pumpkins, a gigantic one and a mini one, in the front yard. A castle-like house stands in the corner. When I returned home, I opened my delivered parcel of a grey-green stone Godzilla. How wonderful it looks! On my mind now, Latinate artificial languages may have advantages over those that are not Latinate. I am thinking of Esperanto and Interlingua. Even natural languages like Tagalog and Japanese are full of international Latinate terms. (In Japanese, they are written in Katakana glyphs. It is fun to read a Japanese menu full of French and Italian food names written in Katakana. And I find it easier to read Japanese books in the sci-fi genre, because they are full of Katakana words derived from English and other languages. (Japanese is a cosmopolitan language.)) I am also thinking that a Latinate language with a blend of the indigenous may be fun and fascinating, as in the case of Philippine Creole Spanish (Chavacano (Chabacano)).",

I said that he could have taken up some other \"habits.\" Then the conversation switched to the topic of Mexican cuisine and its hidden variety. I had pizza and diet black soda at the pizzeria, where there were some South Asians, as clients and vendor, as well as a Cockney-accented white man. Heading home, I saw Michael, who was from Francophone New Brunswick, as he smoked and promenaded on the sidewalk. He bowed to me, as I approached. I then showed him the Thai bowing greeting with pressed palms and said in Thai, \"Sawatdee khrap!\" Michael repeated it. He then said, \"There are all sorts of cultures in the planet, eh?\" Just then, two Sikhs walked by, one in black turban, the other in pink.",

I said that I remembered a big beautiful boarding house there, antique and owned by a gentle Sinospheric family.

As I approached my house, I waved to Derek my Filipino neighbour in a green tracksuit, his mesomorphic silhouette showing. In the sunny afternoon, going back to the pizzeria, I saw, on the other side of the main road, a whole Jewish family with children, all wearing Sabbath synagogue attire. I waved to Gurpreet the Sikh at the gasoline station. At the pizzeria's front, a thickset bicyclist in black parked and locked his bicycle. I ate a pizza slice and drank a cold diet cola.

For example, to express the polite past, we must first take the \"ren'yōkei\", or \"continuative\", conjugation of a given verb and attach it to the auxiliary ます (masu). When we do this with a verb such as のむ (nomu), it becomes のみます (nomimasu), at first. This is the polite form, as ます forms the polite. To properly express the polite past in full, we must add the auxiliary た. The stem of ます (masu) is a simple \"mas-\" sound. Since it ends with an S sound, a change occurs when we attempt to add た. The resulting \"masta\" is difficult to pronounce and not easy to write in Japanese, as it neglects the common consonant-vowel spelling rule. So, a compromise is made, also known as an 音便 (onbin), or, literally, a \"sound convenience\". The \"masta\" takes on an I sound between the stem's end and the auxiliary's beginning. Since there is no \"si\" in Japanese, \"shi\" is used instead. The resulting conjugation is のみました (nomimashita). When pronounced, it may be contracted and read as \"nomimash'ta\".",

Nothing good to eat.\" As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing. \"I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like,\" said he nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth.",

Luckily, Duke Onkled happened to be pouring himself a glass of water. \"Your Omnipotence, have water,\" he offered dutifully. \"Gimme!\" demanded the King, then emptied the glass in a split second. \"Damn, that was awful.",

Many Filipinos do not really want to read in English, as maybe it does not attract them, so they seldom read, but instead watch television, videos, or cinema, most commonly in the indigenous language. I suspect that Roman letters do not attract some Filipinos. Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient Baybayin script, but the Unicode Standard conserves the syllabograms. Tagalog literature is not yet extensive, as is that of neighbouring Indonesia. English is like a fizzy pink soda, whilst Tagalog is like a yellow-brown cassava cake.

In either case, by utilizing the elements of negation in Society, they become apostles of violence, proclaiming the theory of \"creative destruction.\" But instead of creating a utopia on the ruins of their making, they only succeed in setting up, as history shows, another government, which, no matter how just and sound its foundations are in theory, soon becomes in practice more despotic and corrupt."

When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, they read in English, although they commonly speak an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is highly aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, nevertheless, some comics and other literature in Tagalog for the masses. Many Filipinos do not really want to read in English, as maybe it does not attract them, so they seldom read, but instead watch television, videos, or cinema, most commonly in the indigenous language. I suspect that Roman letters do not attract some Filipinos. Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient Baybayin script, but the Unicode Standard conserves the syllabograms. Tagalog literature is not yet extensive, as is that of neighbouring Indonesia. English is like a fizzy pink soda, whilst Tagalog is like a yellow-brown cassava cake. (Some French have stated that Tagalog is more like a grey shark in the sea. But I could imagine some Italians equating Tagalog with squid ink spaghetti.

        "The analysis of gender in religion or spirituality is an esoteric theme. I for one am attracted to Buddhism, because of its masculine viewpoint about reality. Buddhists accept prevailing discontent as a condition of this illusory world, the Māyā hiding true reality, but paradoxically, they promote equanimous joy. They do not believe in sulking, like a happy boy. The portrayal of the woman is very interesting in the rendition of Dàodéjīng by Ursula K. Le Guin: Chapter 6 says, \"The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.\" Chapter 28 says, \"Knowing man, and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world.\" Chapter 61 says, \"By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him.\" Such is Daoism. I know some who might think that turning to religion might be a \"girlie\" gesture, but it is not necessarily so. Some sci-fi buff friends of mine think that all I need is sci-fi as an exercise in understanding reality through irreality, something I have been doing since reading Dr. Seuss imaginary books in Grade 1. I analyse that it may have been originally Dr. Seuss books that encouraged me to pursue the sci-fi imaginarium throughout my life. Some sci-fact buffs, however, incline away from sci-fi, which they may think is childish, frivolous \"hypotheticals.\" I believe also in sci-fact, invigorated by sci-fi excursions."

        "Gnosticism was a religious movement older than Christianity. There were both types of Christian and non-Christian Gnosticism because there was syncretism, or mixing. They believed that humans were trapped in their bodies and in this evil material world that was created by a cosmic disaster, by a malevolent deity who was not Christ. Christian Gnostics believed that Christ was one of the aeons or divine beings from the Pleroma, the Divine Realm, as described in the Apocryphon of John, part of the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic literature. Salvation was by esoteric knowledge, although ultimately self-knowledge. Gnostics believed in the dualism of the good spirit and evil matter. The material world was an evil place from where Gnostics had to escape. They believed that not all humans had the Divine Spark. The aeons emanated from the Ultimate God, the Monad in the Pleroma. The origins of Gnosticism are unclear today, but probably it came from Persia or further east. It had a lot of Greek influences. Today, after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library as leather-bound papyrus codices in a sealed jar in Egypt, in 1945, some people are trying to revive Gnosticism. \"Gnōsis\" is Greek for knowledge.",

Quietness In Finland, silence is not weird but part of the culture and conversations don’t need constant talking always, because quiet moments are completely fine. 3. The Sauna The sauna is an important part of Finnish life it is a place to relax, and being comfortable with the traditions, like nudity, shows respect for the culture. 4. Be Punctual Time management is very important in Finland and can be seen as respect, so whether it’s a meeting or a casual event, always aim to be on time. 5. Learning basics of Finnish Language While many Finns speak excellent English, learning some basic Finnish phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture like “Kiitos”, “Moi”, and “Anteeksi” are helpful in everyday discussion. 6. Connecting with Nature Nature is very important in Finnish culture with enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, and swimming. 7. Coffee is a Big Deal Coffee drinking and \"kahvitauko\", are a daily tradition, often enjoyed with something sweet like korvapuusti. 8. Equality Finnish culture emphasizes equality and humility. Everyone is treated equally, and showing off wealth or status is not appreciated.",

        "Toward a Comparative Japanese-Austronesian I\" by Takao Kawamoto demonstrates that Japanese is cognate with the Austronesian family of languages, the Pacific languages. The demonstration bases itself on pairing a few hundreds of words of Old Japanese (OJ) with words of Proto-Austronesian (PA) or one of its branches. What was this world like in those ancient times? I have heard theories that in ancient Pre-Columbian times, Pacific Islanders made voyages reaching as far as the Pacific coasts of the Americas. I believe such did happen. So, there were likely contacts between Polynesian tribes and Amerindian tribes. \"Linguistic Evidence for a Prehistoric Polynesia—Southern California Contact Event\" by Kathryn Klar and Terry L. Jones expounds on the theme, mentioning the Amerindian language groups Chumashan and Gabrielino in southern California. Some Pre-Columbian contact between the Americas and Polynesia is evident from the ubiety of the South American sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) in Polynesian archaeological sites, most notably from Mangaia, Cook Islands (circa 1000 CE)."

A brown man in a white T-shirt and sleeveless black vest came to get coffee, his muscular arms writhing. I spent a minute in the woods. As I approached my house, I waved to Derek my Filipino neighbour in a green tracksuit, his mesomorphic silhouette showing. In the sunny afternoon, going back to the pizzeria, I saw, on the other side of the main road, a whole Jewish family with children, all wearing Sabbath synagogue attire. I waved to Gurpreet the Sikh at the gasoline station. At the pizzeria's front, a thickset bicyclist in black parked and locked his bicycle. I ate a pizza slice and drank a cold diet cola. Northbound, homebound, I could see the snowcapped mountains.

USA, EU, UAE, India, and PRC are all roving on or encircling Mars with their robots. Mars would be humanity's second planetary home, some would hope.",
        "Whilst I was drinking my medium-sized iced green tea at the cafe, Hans the Netherlander rolled in through the entrance in his wheelchair. He gave me a little piece of sugarless candy. He ordered coffee. He said that he was going to celebrate his friend's birthday at the Greek restaurant Kisamos Taverna in Steveston village, here on Lulu Island, at 6 PM, today the 28th of October of 2021. He called for a taxi. I once ate moussaka in that restaurant. I said that I remembered when Steveston was not so touristy and my mother worked in the bank there in the 1970s. Apparently, his daughter works at the bank there. Meanwhile, a big handsome white man came in through the entrance, then went in and out of the washroom, then took a coffee cup from the counter, then exited the cafe. I then said that I had to go. Hans decided that he would take the bus, instead of waiting for the taxi.",
        "Today on the 12th of January of 2022, at the cafe, I had a glass of black iced tea. Upon exiting, I greeted Hans the Netherlander on a wheelchair a happy new year. We briefly discussed about the ongoing deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope to the Sun-Earth L2 Langrange point. The worry at the moment is about micrometeorites. Incidentally, Hans mentioned a Scottish friend Tom who took a lethal injection yesterday at his hospice because he had cancer.",
        "In the afternoon of the 23rd of February of 2022, at the cafe, I sat at my favourite corner table to drink my iced green tea, which on other times, I alternate with iced passionfruit tea and iced black tea. Hans the Netherlander hobby astronomer sat at a central table. There were young people with strange hairdos, like samurai top knot, or big and curly, or long and red-tinted. Homebound, I had to use the washroom in the pizzeria, where there were Eurasian students.",

At a table beyond mine was a blond student with big biceps with tattoos. Hans the Netherlander rolled in with his wheelchair. I joined him at another table. There, we discussed multibillionaires: Elon Musk's space technology and Bill Gates' medical technology. Then, we discussed the Yucatan. I said that I have been to the temples at Tulum, near a cliff overlooking a white sandy beach, looking like a science fiction set. The other day, he mentioned that Netherlanders ate eel. I suggested that he try the \"unagi donburi,\" sweet glazed eel on rice, at the nearby Japanese restaurant.",

At the cafe, I drank my usual iced black tea. There were handsome men in green and black, or in grey, or in black. There were many students. A couple of girls carried multicoloured flowers. Hans the Netherlander astronomy buff talked about the ongoing politics with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Coincidentally, a family of Russian-speaking Eurasians just from the barbershop, owned by a Middle Easterner, passed through the cafe. The cafe ambiance was not exactly like in Ten Forward, the crew lounge in the Star Trek franchise.",
        "I walked at night, here on Lulu Island. As I entered Starbucks café, sitting at a table with two Doritos bags of chips, one purple and one red, were Peter the redheaded Anglo and Hans the Netherlander on a motorized wheelchair, who offered to me. I took a few chips from both bags. Then, I was drinking reddish Passion Tango iced tea, then Oat Nog Latte. I was munching on crème brûlée almonds. I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish). I said that it was \"rāmen.\" Homebound, walking, I accidentally tripped on a wooden board in a dark alleyway. My eyeglasses fell off. Luckily, I was not hurt. A Cantonese labourer helped me. Today is the 14th of December of 2024.",

        "On the 1st of November of 2021, I joined Hans the Netherlander at his table in the cafe. The day after Halloween was rainy outside. Whilst I was drinking iced green tea, Hans gave me a piece of brown candy. He took out a jar of peanuts and offered me, but I said that I get pimples from peanuts. As a child in Quezon City, my family had a peanut farm near our lot; we boiled them, and I ate, as I was not allergic as a prepubescent. We then talked all about astronomy: exoplanets, asteroids, and the moons of the gas giants. Titan, a moon of Saturn, is specially stunning with its black methanic rivers, lakes, and seas. Hans said that the next fifty years will be exciting for astronomy. As we talked, a big handsome man with a muscular build came in, ordered coffee, and left.",
        "On the 12th of April of 2022, at the Lulu Island cafe, I talked to Hans the Netherlander about astronomy. The recent pictures of Jupiter's atmosphere are stunningly more distinct and vivid than ever before, like a swirling colourful cold soup.",

In the afternoon, I drank black iced tea at the cafe, where I talked to my Anglo-Saxon neighbours Barb and Ken about travelling around this world, Mayan and Aztec pyramids in Mexico, the creole languages in the Caribbean, the otherworldly buildings in the Greek Islands, our common knowledge of prestigious French, and our experiences of the Pandemic, and then talked to Hans the Netherlander about the months-long adjustment phase of the new James Webb Space Telescope, the Jovian atmosphere with lightnings, artifacts of Ancient Egypt, lightning-made glass, and dinosaur bones. At the cafe, I noticed two different round-headed stocky men, who came in and out.",
        "At the cafe the rainy day after Halloween of 2021, Hans the Netherlander mentioned to me that Italian food was \"acquired taste\" for him. He mentioned the method of tenderizing octopus and the way the ink complimented the dish. I mentioned the black squid ink spaghetti. I said that I liked all seafood, including octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, which made him squirm. Then, I mentioned that I liked moussaka, a Greek lasagna-type dish with eggplants. Hans said that as a Netherlander, he liked \"plain meat and potatoes.\" But Netherlanders do eat raw herring.",
        "Today is the 14th of January of 2025. It was night at Time Hortons café. I ate Sea Salt Potato Wedges with Wildberry Hibiscus Lemonade Quencher. Joban the South Asian was my vendor. In the morning, I had a couple or more cups of Green Tea with Oat Milk, which, someone expressed, \"tastes like ice cream.\" It was night at Starbucks café. I ate two Belgian Liège Waffles. The Brown Sugar Oat Cortado interestingly tasted like jackfruit. I was going to tell the Japanese-Anglo hybrid Chris the barista or Jess the Anglo barista. Money is just an inhibitor, sometimes. Money is poverty, sometimes. Life should always be sensual, a sensory wonderland. Life is ephemeral, full of fleeting experiences. Do I believe in the Akashic Records, the memory compendium about everything? The following day of the 15th, I saw Hans the Netherlander in his motorized wheelchair at Tim Hortons. We sat near the sun-drenched bay window, as we chatted and ate Sea Salt Potato Wedges. I was drinking Orange Pekoe tea with Oat Milk for a change.",
        "In the afternoon of the 5th of February of 2022, I ate pizza at the pizzeria. Then, at the cafe, I saw Hans the Netherlander. I told him that the James Webb Space Telescope had been deployed. He gave me a cold mocha frappuccino, to add to my passion fruit iced tea that I already had. Lyle was there, wearing all black, with cargo pants that hid his robust legs. Don was at a front table, reading from a device."

Heading home, I saw Michael, who was from Francophone New Brunswick, as he smoked and promenaded on the sidewalk. He bowed to me, as I approached. I then showed him the Thai bowing greeting with pressed palms and said in Thai, \"Sawatdee khrap!\" Michael repeated it.

He is a devout Baptist Protestant, converted in Canada from Roman Catholicism, who carries his Bible to the café. I told him that when my father was alive, our house had Bible meetings for our Filipino Baptist community. I told Greg that I'm Buddhist. I talked to him about Buddhism and Daoism, this latter of which he knew little. I'm glad to meet a Filipino, like me, who came to Canada very young and has lived in Canada for a vaster period."

Rod believes that there is \"one God,\" but I say that God could be either singular or plural, as number is a limitation on God. I wonder if he is a \"pantheist\" or \"panpsychist,\" who believes that there is, at some level, the divine or the mind, respectively, in everybody and everything, even a \"pillow.\" The terminology excites him. He shows me a video describing the complex Aztec calendar on his smartphone. The presentation is full of Aztec, aka Nahuatl, words, which he mistakes for \"Mayan.\" I tell him that in ancient Mexico, the Aztecs were more like the Japanese, whilst the Maya were more like the Chinese. I utter some words presented in Nahuatl. He does not look too surprised that I know how to pronounce. We both have visited Mexico before."

After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government, ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013."

So, a compromise is made, also known as an 音便 (onbin), or, literally, a \"sound convenience\". The \"masta\" takes on an I sound between the stem's end and the auxiliary's beginning.

I took a few chips from both bags. Then, I was drinking reddish Passion Tango iced tea, then Oat Nog Latte. I was munching on crème brûlée almonds. I was exercising with my hand grip strengthener at my table. There were a regular couple with seemingly American spoken accents. The man was a handsome white-haired bear, always wearing a sports outfit. At Hans' request after he exited, Peter gave the purple Doritos bag to me and the red one to Chris the Japanese-English hybrid, who was a barista. The other barista was Jessica the petite Vietnamese. There were Filipino customers. Jessica asked me if I knew what was \"lomi\" (a Filipino noodle dish).

Secondly, I ate a sausage egg English muffin meal, including a hash brown and oat milk iced coffee. I went to Starbucks for an oat nog latte. I missed Greg, my Filipino friend, who left just before me. Then, I went to Yummy Slice pizzeria for a red-can Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The Filipina vendor Rose was there, so we said \"Happy New Year\" to each other. I passed by Kin's Farm fruteria. On my way home, in the park's alleyway, I met and talked with my ufologist friend, Michael J., a Dane-French. He amused himself with the red touque on my head, with orange letters in Tagalog: \"MGA AWSTRALYA ANG MGA ESTRELYA\" (The stars are Australias). I told him it was about \"space colonization.\" There are the cold and hot deserts of other worlds. Then, I went to the house of my \"auntie\" neighbour, Tita Zeny, to pick up her homemade \"dinuguán\" or Filipino pork blood stew to bring home. Lunch at home would include Filipino chicken \"adobo.",

Greg gifted me a chocolate croissant. At Starbucks café, in the grey-sky afternoon, I was drinking the seasonal Oat Nog Latte. (Incidentally, Nog is a dwarf-like Ferengi alien character in the Star Trek franchise.) Kristina, part-Inuit part-Norwegian, was my barista. She has a handsome face, and her mannerisms and style reflect some things about her Inuit ancestors. \"Viktor, it's like you're part-Inuit,\" she told me. She knows that I am from the Philippines. At my table, I exercised with my hand grip strengthener, which I carried in my army jacket pocket. At the café, I greeted Don the alluring white man and Květa the solitary Czech lady, as I exited.

I stopped at Yummy Slice pizzeria for a Diet Coke and Subway sandwitcheria for a Turkey Ranch \"Snackwich\" just before the café. Heading home, I then visited Kin's Farm fruteria. Grandma Taiwan was there at the front: \"Míng sà la!\" she exclaimed. The lotus roots were out of stock. The wind was ferocious, as I walked back home. The neighbourhood Tim Hortons will be opening soon. Today is the 14th of December of 2024.",
        "Whilst drinking my Oat Nog Latte at Starbucks café, this grey-sky morning, I was talking to Afroz, a worker at Kin's Farm Market on Lulu Island, which I frequent to buy exotic things (to others) like lotus roots, Japanese yams, kumquats, dragonfruits, longans, jujubes, Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes, passion fruits, star fruits, etc. Afroz is what he categorizes himself as a \"generic Indian Muslim.\" He was from Uttar Pradesh. His last city was Mumbai, before he left for BC. His daughter has been left with her grandparents in India. Afroz lives with his wife, a caregiver, in Vancouver. Afroz has an MBA from India, but he says that it is difficult to attain his dream job of doing marketing. I told him that my Auntie Vicky from the Philippines was working as a manager for Tupperware (a plastic container company) in India, as she lived in a \"palace\" with servants. I could not visit her at that time because I was working. (She also worked in Thailand, which I did visit.) It is the 8th of December of 2024, today."

An odd cabinet mirror stood by the sidewalk, so I could see my bare legs and mauve garden shoes in the reflection. I walked to Tim Hortons, there to drink an iced coffee with oat milk.
