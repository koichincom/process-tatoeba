# Processor Tatoeba

This project converts Tatoeba's TSV dataset into optimized JSON files, where each word is grouped with up to 100 example sentences. The output is categorized by the first letter of each word for efficient lookup. Please download the original TSV file from [weekly exports > sentences](https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads). This project is primarily for my project, [inthelang](https://github.com/koichincom/inthelang), a context-based flashcard app. I use this processed Tatoeba data to suggest example sentences based on uses' inputs. There's an output folder and processed data, but I can't guarantee they're the latest data. The Tatoeba data is updated every week, so I would recommend downloading and processing by using the C++ and Python files in this repository.
